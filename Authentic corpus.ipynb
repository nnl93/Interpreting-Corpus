But to summarize, the highest priority will be to maintain sustainable economic growth, it can be expected that the economic environment facing China will continue to be serious and complex. We must be prepared for potential adversity and handle the changing situation in a calm fashion. We need to maintain steady economic growth, prevent inflation and control latent risks, so-so that there won’t be big fluctuations in our economic performance. To realize the goal we have set for our country by 2020, we would have to register an annual GDP growth rate of around seven point five percent, that would not be easy.

We need to combine the dividends of reform, the potential of domestic demand, and creativity and vitality of creativity, so that this will together form new drivers of economic growth.

If the people are to lead good lives then the government must be put on a tight budget. Recently, I have received report that central government fiscal revenues only increased by 1.6 percent in January and February of this year. In the future, you might not see high speed growth of fiscal revenues in China. However, spending on items related to people’s lives is a must. It will only increase, not decrease. That means we would have to cut spending on government operations. Here, let me lay down three clear rules: Within the term of my government, First, we will not use government coffers to construct any new offices, house or guesthouses for the government. Second, the number of people on the government’s payroll will decrease, not increase. Third, spending on official hospitality, overseas trips for official business and the use-the purchase of official vehicles will decrease, not increase.

They say, we hope to lead the same kind of life as our urban counterparts. In the past, this was just a dream, but urbanization has opened the door for the dream to come true. Some rural residents may wish to migrate to the cities to engage in secondary or tertiary industries, others might want to stay in their villages and engage in farming operations of appropriate scale.

Urbanization is not about building big sprawling cities. We need to ensure proper balance between large, medium and small cities, and the eastern, central and western regions of China should pursue organization in light of their local conditions. It’s also very important to prevent the typical malaise that might plague big cities, so that we won’t have a situation where skyscrapers coexist with shanty towns. Within the term of this government, we are determined to redevelop over ten million different types of shanty dwellings so as to overcome the bifurcation within cities and to lower the threshold of urbanization.

The Hong Kong society is open, inclusive and vibrant. and there is great space for deepening the cooperation between the mainland and Hong Kong, the central government will do its level best to advance-advance those initiatives that will enhance the well-being of our compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao, that deepen the cooperation between the mainland and Hong Kong and Macao that will contribute to the long term prosperity of Hong Kong and Macao.</text>\n",

      "<text> You asked about my personal experience and mentioned Anhui in your question, I was once a sent-town youth in Fengyang County in Anhui province. I won’t forget the hard times I have spent with the local peasants. Fengyang was known for its poverty across the country and it was also the place where the rural household responsibility system reform originated. I still remember in 1977, I-when I was working in the fields, I learned of the news that I was enrolled by university. Reform and opening-up has changed the destiny of our nation and lifted hundreds of millions of peasants out of poverty. It has also changed the life course of many individuals, including me. Now the heavy responsibility of reform has fallen on the shoulders of our generation, we will do our best to make sure that the dividends of reform will reach everyone in our society, so that the elderly will enjoy their old age, and the young will be full of hope, and our country will be full of vitality.</text>\n",

They say, our political relations are in very good shape er there is nothing that we don’t agree on, so why don’t we spending more time talking about enhancing our practical cooperation. And in my contacts with local government personnel and people from outside the government, I get the strong sense that they have a strong desire to raise the level of practical cooperation and leverage the economic complementarity between the two sides. I remember during the trip,  I attended an economic and trade forum, I said that currently the bilateral trade stood at 80 billion US dollars, through our joint efforts may be we can more than double that in the years ahead and that will deliver benefits to both sides.</text>\n",

      "女士们，先生们，大家上午好。今天我们很高兴地邀请到新任国务院总理和几位副总理与大家见面。我们先请李克强总理讲话。之后，他会回答大家提出的问题。\n",
      "女士们、先生们，记者朋友们，首先啊感谢大家在中国两会报道中所付出的辛劳。\n",
      "这里我向大家介绍一下一起来的几位副总理。张高丽副总理。\n",
      "刘延东副总理。\n",
      "汪洋副总理。\n",
      "马凯副总理。\n",
      "我们啊衷心感谢人民代表的信任，从担任新职的那一刻起，我就深感这是全国各族人民的重托，是重大责任。我们将忠诚于宪法，忠实于人民，以民之所望为施政所向。把努力实现人民对未来生活的期盼作为神圣使命，以对法律的敬畏、对人民的敬重、敢于担当、勇于作为的政府，去造福全体人民，建设强盛国家。这几句话是我的开场白，下边呢就欢迎记者朋友们提问。\n",
      "中区第五排右边，新加坡《联合早报》。\n",
      "哦，谢谢，新加坡《联合早报》。呃这一次的那个国务院机构改革方案引起外界的高度关注，那么我们想请问李总理的是，呃这次的改革是不是您理想的方案？那么要如何才能达到这个简政放权跟呃转变政府职能的这个目标？谢谢。\n",
      "呃你谈到理想，凡事我想啊要做成的话，总是要在理想和现实之间啊作出可能的选择。这次改革方案核心是转变政府职能，当然也是简政放权。如果说机构改革啊是政府内部权力的优化配置，那么转变职能则是厘清和理顺政府与市场、与社会之间的关系。说白了，就是市场能办的，多放给市场。社会可以做好的，就交给社会。政府呢管住、管好它应该管的事。\n",
      "呃机构改革不易，转变职能啊更难，因为它更深刻。我经常在地方调研的时候啊，常听到这样的抱怨，办个事、创个业要盖几十个公章，群众说啊恼火得很。这既影响了效率，也容易有腐败或者说叫寻租行为，损害了政府的形象。所以必须从改革行政审批制度入手来转变政府职能。现在国务院各部门啊行政审批事项还有1700多项，本届政府下决心要再削减三分之一以上。\n",
      "不是说政府有错位的问题吗？那就把错装在政府身上的手换成市场的手。这是削权，是自我革命，会很痛，甚至有割腕的感觉，但是啊这是发展的需要，是人民的愿望。我们要有壮士断腕的决心，言出必行，说到做到，决不啊明放暗不放，避重就轻，更不能啊搞变相游戏。谢谢。\n",
      "谢谢。继续提问。南区第二排这位女士。好。\n",
      "谢谢主持人。总理您好，我是人民日报和人民网的记者。很多人都认为，新一届政府所面临的任务十分艰巨。那么，我想请问总理，您的施政目标是什么？您打算首先去解决的主要问题又是什么？谢谢。\n",
      "这是一个大问题啊。关于施政目标啊，可以说中共十八大已经做出了全面部署，这就是本届政府的施政目标。在我们啊离实现现代化越近的时候，遇到的风险和挑战就会越多。偌大的中国啊要解决的事很多，如果说主要问题的话，我想啊，第一，还是持续发展经济。可以料想，未来中国经济环境啊依然是严峻复杂，我们要居安思危，也要处变不惊，保持经济持续增长，防范通货膨胀，控制潜在风险，使中国经济啊不发生大的波动。还要努力去实现2020年的目标，测算一下，这需要年均增长啊7.5%的速度，这不容易。但是，我们有有利的条件，有巨大的内需。关键在推动经济转型，把改革的红利、内需的潜力、创新的活力叠加起来，形成新动力，并且使啊质量和效益、就业和收入、环境保护和资源节约有新提升，来打造中国经济的升级版。\n",
      "第二，是不断改善民生。也就是说要着力啊提高城乡居民，特别是揪-低收入者的收入，持续地扩大中等收入的群体。如果说政府也是民生政府的话，就要重点保障基本民生，来编织一张啊覆盖全民的，保障基本民生的安全网。其中包括义务教育、医疗、养老保险、住房等，努力啊逐步把短板补上。还要坚持网底不破，通过完善低保、大病救助等制度啊，兜住特困群体的基本生活。这些人如果陷入生活的窘境，很容易啊冲击社会的道德和心理底线，所以政府要尽力，并且调动社会的力量，保障啊人们的基本生存权利和人格尊严。\n",
      "第三，是要促进社会公正。公正啊是社会创造活力的源泉，也是提高人民满意度的一杆秤，政府理应是社会公正的守护者。我们要努力使啊人人享有平等的机会，不论是来自城市还是农村，不论是来自啊怎样的家庭背景，只要通过自身的努力，就可以取得应有的回报。不论是怎样的财富创造者，是国企、民企还是个体经营者，只要靠诚信公平竞争，都可以获得应有的成功。\n",
      "解决这三个问题，也可以说是实现三项任务，还需要有三大保障。一是建设创新政府，依靠改革开放使经济社会啊充满活力；二是建设廉洁政府，增强政府的公信力、执行力和效率；三是啊建设\n",
      "推进这三项任务的实现，应该说要付出艰辛的努力。好在啊我的前任温家宝总理和已经离任的同事们打下了好基础，我们对他们啊表示深深的敬意。我们也坚信，在以习近平同志为总书记的中共中央领导下，依靠13亿人的勤劳、智慧，我们会不断地走向成功，去实现民族复兴、实现现代化。\n",
      "你代我先说了thank you，哈哈哈哈哈哈。\n",
      "谢谢，请继续提问。呃中区第六排中间那位女士，啊对这位女士。对对。\n",
      "谢谢主持人，总理，您好。我是中央人民广播电台和中国广播网的记者，我们注意到呢最近一段时期，一些地方接连曝光腐败案件，呃那么我们想问一下总理，新一届政府将会采取哪些具体的措施，让反腐败在人民心中呃嗯让人民呢对反腐败更有信心？谢谢。\n",
      "啊我要补充感谢呃对刚才人民日报和人民网的提问，呃而且认为啊你提的问题十分重要。因为腐败和我们政府的性质可以说水火不容，中国政府反对腐败的决心和意志啊是坚定不移的，这里呢我也想表个态。\n",
      "为政清廉啊应该先从自己做起，己正，才能正人，这是古训，也是真理。自古有所谓“为官发财，应当两道”。既然担任了公职，为公众服务，就要断掉发财的念想。我们愿意接受全社会、接受媒体的监督。\n",
      "我们还要建立和完善不能贪、不敢贪的反腐机制，让啊腐败行为、腐败分子依法受到严惩，绝不手软。更重要的是，要让权力在公开透明的环境中运行，使人民能够更为充分和有效地进行监督，这也是把权力涂上防腐剂，只能为公，不能私用。\n",
      "呃我们还要用简朴的政府啊来取信于民，造福人民，要让人民过上好日子，政府就要过紧日子。前一段我收到财政报告，1到2月份，中央财政的收入啊增幅只有1.6%，可以啊推想，未来财政啊再保持高速增长的收入态势不大可能了，但是民生支出是刚性的，不能减，只能增，那就需要削减政府的开支。这里呢我们也约法三章，本届政府内，一是政府性的楼堂馆所一律不得新建；二是财政供养的人员只减不增；三是公费接待、公费出国、公费购车只减不增。这三条啊中央政府要带头做起，一级做给一级看。谢谢。\n",
      "好下一位记者。北区第一排中间美联社。\n",
      "美联社的，呃Associated Press. 呃李总理呃，中国提出与美国构建新型的大国关系，那么中方希望美国做些什么？包括所谓美国战略重心转向亚洲。另外中国是否会停止对美国的黑客攻击？因为这一问题现呃现已引起对美国国家安全的关注。Er Premier Li er, China has called for building a new type of relationship with the US, what would the Chinese side like the US to do including with the so-called US pivot to Asia, will China stop the cyber attacking against the US er since it has now become er an issue of American national security.\n",
      "你自己给自己当翻译应该拿双份工资。\n",
      "呃，你提的问题使我想起前两天，我看美国媒体的报道\n",
      "呃我也想起上世纪80年代，到美国去访问啊，正值美国大选，两党的人士我都有接触，他们都跟我说：你放心，无论谁当选，对华合作和一个中国的政策立场不会改变。呃虽然啊中美关系几十年来历经风风雨雨，但是一直向前走，为什么？这说明中美关系啊符合两国人民的根本利益，也符合世界和平发展的大势。\n",
      "新一届中国政府会和过去一样，高度重视啊中美关系，因为这是最大发展中国家和最大发达国家之间的关系，我们愿与奥巴马政府啊共同去构建新型大国关系。\n",
      "你问到怎么构建，这使我又想起啊在中央政府工作后，我经常会见美国的政治家，他们和我谈话，很坦率，说我是为美国利益而来，我跟他们说，我是为啊中国利益工作。既然大家都讲利益，那好，利益就有共同点、汇合点。可以回想一下，30多年前，中美的贸易额不过10亿美金，去年已经达到近5000亿美金。我们继续推进啊互利共赢。我想未来中美在贸易、投资方面的机会、空间比过去30年会更大，会给两国人民啊带来实实在在的利益。\n",
      "当然，我不否认中美之间有分歧，但只要我们相互尊重啊对方的重大关切，管控好分歧，就可以使共同利益超越分歧。中美创造的独特的文明、文化也可以互学互鉴，增进两国人民之间的友谊，夯实中美关系的社会基础。\n",
      "至于说到亚太地区，这可以说是中美利益交汇、集结最密切的地区，中美都表示要维护地区的稳定、促进繁荣，我希望言行一致，从亚太地区做起、做好，来构建新型大国关系，\n",
      "啊你说到的黑客攻击问题啊，这可以说是一个世界性的问题，中国本身就是主要的被黑客攻击的受害者，中方不仅不支持，而且反对黑客攻击行为。刚才你说的话我怎么有有罪推定的感觉啊？我想我们还是啊少做些啊没有根据的相互指责，多做维护网络安全的实事。\n",
      "谢谢。\n",
      "谢谢，请继续提问。中区第三排第-北起第五位那位女-男士。对。\n",
      "谢谢主持人，总理，您好。我是中央电视台和中国网络电视台的记者，您多次提到说改革是中国最大的红利，我最近呢也注意到在一些主要的网站上，包括中央电视台联合多家网站推出的我有问题问总理这个网页上，好多网友都在讨论这句话，呃也有诸多的期待。但是我们知道呢，现在中国的改革已经呢进入了深水区，社会上呢普遍说深水区的改革呢相当的困难，可能会触及到一些利益群体，甚至这些利益群体可能会形成对改革的阻力。那在这种情况下怎么样通过改革来释放红利？对下一步的这个推进改革您有什么样的考虑？或者说着力点主要在哪些方面？谢谢。\n",
      "呃我之所以说啊改革是最大的红利，是因为我国社会主义市场经济啊还在完善过程中，靠改革进一步解放生产力还有巨大的空间，让改革的红利惠及全体人民还有啊巨大的潜力。改革呢贵在行动啊，喊破嗓子不如甩开膀子。我们需要坚持啊市场化的改革方向，如果说到重点的话，那就围绕我前面讲的三项任务啊去推进能够牵一发动全身的改革。\n",
      "呃推动经济转型啊要注意发挥财政、金融、价格的杠杆性作用，来推动啊公开、透明、规范、完整的财政预算制度改革，可以使人民更有效地监督财政收支、优化收支状况，也可以啊更多地倾向于民生。啊在金融领域推进利率、汇率市场化改革，发展多层次的资本市场，来提高直接融资的比重，而且呢要保护投资者，尤其是中小投资者的合法权益。我们还可以啊用开放来带动转型，重点是进一步开放服务业。当然，中国的贸易，还包括啊商品的贸易，未来几年呢都会继续甚至是比较高幅度地增长，这对世界啊是一个巨大的机会，对于中国企业也是啊在公平竞争当中啊提升企业层级的好机会。\n",
      "改善民生那离不开收入分配制度的改革。我们应当啊敢于直面城乡、区域两个最大的差距。特别是啊直面啊有八亿多农民和五亿多市民之间的涉及人口最多的差距，采取措施啊，逐步使其缩小。还要推动社会保障制度的改革，逐步提高统筹的层次，使啊医疗、养老报销、接续啊能够逐步地实现异地进行，这也有利于啊劳动力的流动。\n",
      "要推动啊促进社会公正的改革，不断地清理有碍社会公正的规则，而且要使明规则战胜潜规则。呃同时呢，推动啊民营资本顺利有效地进入金融、能源、铁路啊等领域，还要对社会领域的相关改革进行推进，促进社会的纵向流动。比如说现在高等学校里啊农村的学生比例偏少，我们要逐步提高比例，让更多勤奋好学的农村孩子感受到希望。\n",
      "嗯当然，改革既要突出重点，也要统筹协调。我们推进的是各个领域的全面改革，是为了推动啊中国特色社会主义事业不断前进。\n",
      "至于你刚才说到改革进入了深水区，也可以说是攻坚期，的确是因为啊它要触动固有的利益格局。啊现在触动利益可以说比触及灵魂还难。但是，再深的水我们也得趟，因为别无选择，它关乎国家的命运、民族的前途。呃这需要啊勇气、智慧、韧性。所幸的是，这些呀可以从我们的人民当中去汲取，来使改革啊迈出坚实的步伐。谢谢。\n",
      "谢谢，请继续提问。呃中区第五排的第三位那位男士第三位哎。\n",
      "谢谢主持人。李总理您好，我是台湾《联合报》的记者。近年来，两岸关系获得了很大的发展，请问总理您对于未来进一步推动两岸关系和平发展有什么样的规划和愿景？也就是说新形势下两岸关系的机遇和挑战在哪里？谢谢。\n",
      "嗯两岸同属一个中国，居住在两岸的是骨肉同胞。“同胞”这个词啊，这个理念在中华文化当中是根深蒂固的，我认为啊这也是中华民族五千年生生不息的根源。所谓打断骨头啊还连着筋，同胞之间、手足之情，没有啊解不开的结。\n",
      "呃我们高兴地看到啊，这些年两岸关系啊向着和平发展的方向发展，两岸合作的成果啊在不断取得。我想，只要维护一个中国，维护同胞之情，两岸关系啊发展的空间和潜力巨大。\n",
      "我们应该充分地利用啊当前的机遇，而且使未来的机遇啊不断地扩大。新一届政府啊将会履行上届政府所做的承诺，并且呢要努力寻求啊合作的新的推动支点。呃在推动大陆的进一步开放和发展当中，会更多地考虑啊台胞的福祉和利益，我们愿意呀与台湾共享发展的机遇。\n",
      "台湾在-台湾和台胞啊在发展当中，可以更多地利用我们大陆发展的机遇。大陆和台湾呀是我们共同的家园，把它一道啊维护好、建设好，使其花团锦簇，我想花好啊总有月圆时。也请你能够转达我对台湾同胞真诚的问候和祝福。谢谢。\n",
      "谢谢，请继续提问。北区第七排的那位男士。第七排，对。对。\n",
      "谢谢主持人，我是新华社记者。嗯当前社会上有很多关于这个城镇化的讨论，也出现了不同的声音。有人认为城镇化是现代化进程自然而然的结果，所以没有必要主动去推进。也有人担心随着城镇化的推进呢，会有很多的农民失去土地，进而形成一个新的阶层，城市贫民阶层。不知道总理怎么看？谢谢。\n",
      "这又是一个大问题，我尽量用短时间来回答呃这个问题。呃你刚才讲到的呃社会上对城镇化有许多议论，呃我大都听到了，也很关注。\n",
      "城镇化是现代化的必然趋势，也是广大农民的普遍愿望，它不仅可以带动巨大的消费和投资需求，创造啊更多的就业机会，其直接作用还是富裕农民、造福人民。我在农村呐调研的时候，经常和农民们聊天，他们在谈到啊对未来生活的愿望时，不少人啊用一句简洁的话来表达，说是啊希望过上和城里人一样好的日子。这在过去对农民来说是奢望。中国城镇化的大门呐给农民打开了，啊，农民可以进城从事二三产业，留在农村的，通过适度规模经营，都可以增收致富。现在每年呀有一千多万农民转移到城镇，这是必然的趋势。\n",
      "呃我们强调的新型城镇化，是以人为核心的城镇化。现在大约有两亿六千万农民工，使他们中有愿望的人逐步融入城市啊，这是一个长期复杂的过程，要有就业支撑，有服务保障。而且呢城镇化也不是靠摊大饼，还是要大、中、小城市协调发展，东、中、西部啊地区因地制宜地推进。还要注意防止城市病，不能一边是高楼林立啊，一边是棚户连片。本届政府下决心要再改造一千万户以上各类棚户区，这既是解决城市内部的二元结构，也是呢降低城镇化的门槛。尤为重要的是，新型城镇化必须和农业现代化相辅相成，保住耕地红线，保障粮食安全，保护农民利益。\n",
      "城镇化是一个复杂的系统工程，会带来啊经济和社会深刻的变化，也需要各项配套改革啊去推进。在推进过程中，也会并且必须解决啊遇到的各种问题。据说这次两会期间啊，关于城镇化的建议和提案已经500多件了，还在统计之中，我们将会啊认真地一一研究，使其呢能够啊稳步地积极地稳妥地向前推进。\n",
      "谢谢。哈哈。\n",
      "下一位记者。中区第三排靠右边法国《费加罗报》。\n",
      "***Um nowadays um envir-environment pollution and food safety become a very, very serious issue, we can see the sky in Beijing um this weekend, is it possible for the Chinese government is it still possible to solve these problems while maintaining um the speed of economic development? And will it give more space for Chinese people and media uh to monitor these issues? Thank you.\n",
      "我前面讲啊，要打造中国经济的升级版，就包括在发展中要尽力啊让人民呼吸洁净的空气，饮用安全的水，食用啊放心食品。刚才记者先生啊讲到一段时期，北京，实际上中国东部啊比较大范围出现雾霾天气，我和大家一样，心情都很沉重。对这一长期积累形成的问题啊，我们要下更大的决心，以更大的作为去进行治理。特别是对重点地区，已经查明的人为因素啊，要限期治理，对于水污染、土地的状况啊，要摸清底数，进行啊坚决的整治。至于食品安全，那可以说是天大的事，他都是啊直接关系到人们的生活质量和身体健康。政府呢应该对假冒伪劣和黑心食品啊坚决进行查处，并且让不法分子付出啊昂贵的代价。\n",
      "我还担心的是啊，粗放的发展方式啊能不能加快得到转变。我曾经说过，绿水青山贫穷落后不行，但殷实富裕环境恶化也不行。我们需要进一步创新发展理念，推动科学发展。一是啊要不能再欠新账，包括提高环保的门槛；二是啊加快还旧账，包括淘汰落后产能等。政府啊应当铁腕执法、铁面问责。\n",
      "我们不能以牺牲环境啊来换取人民并不满意的增长，所以这里很重要的是，不论是污染的状况、食品问题，还是啊治理和处置的效果，都要公开、透明进行，让公众、媒体啊能够充分、有效地加以监督，这也是形成一种倒逼机制，硬化企业和政府的责任，也可以增强啊人们自身的防护意识。既然同呼吸，就要共奋斗，大家都尽一把力。政府则是要以更大的决心来让人民放心。谢谢。\n",
      "谢谢，请继续提问。南区第八排的那位女士，第八排。对。\n",
      "谢谢主持人，总理，您好。我是中国日报和中国日报网的记者，刚才您谈到了很多改革的目标和举措，我们也一直十分关注中国劳教制度的改革。我们也想知道，中国劳教制度改革有没有一个时间表？谢谢您。\n",
      "请允许我简要地回答你。呃有关中国劳教制度的改革方案，有关部门正在抓紧研究制定，年内有望出台。谢谢。\n",
      "谢谢，继续提问。北区第三排的那位男士。对。\n",
      "谢谢主持人，总理您好。我是香港凤凰卫视记者胡一虎。刚刚我注意到一个细节，您在回答所有媒体同业的时候，您的双手举起来超过了有30几次。这一幕让我印象深刻，想起了11年前，当时采访时任河南省长的您展现出来的自信跟睿智。我想问的是，两年前您到访香港，带去了中央政府的大礼包，未来有哪些新的举措？另外，我要特别要说的是，我也是安徽省籍的人，但我出生在台湾、工作在香港、在过去十多年来一直穿梭在两岸三地的华文媒体人。我身旁的人外界渴望对您本人希望有更进一步的了解，能不能借这个机会，谈谈您从政生涯一路走来从最基层到最高层您个人的情怀，谢谢总理。\n",
      "刚才记者先生提醒我啊，手势多了，引起人们的注意力啊，就会呃不太注意听我回答问题的内容了。\n",
      "不过你刚才讲的三地都是容易啊引起我情感的问题。\n",
      "我记得前年到香港访问，呃宣布了中央政府支持香港繁荣，推动两地啊深化合作的一系列政策，你把它比喻为“大礼包”倒是很形象。不过这个“大礼包”的干货啊要一个一个打开，才能用好、用足，还需要两地呀共同努力。啊现在已经取得了一些效果，中央政府会尽力去推进。我访港的时候啊，深感呃“一国两制”下的香港充满活力，香港同胞勤劳、智慧，香港社会啊包容、开放、充满活力，内地和香港合作空间还很大。凡是啊有利于港澳同胞福祉增加、内地和港澳深化合作、维护啊港澳长期繁荣的事，中央政府都会尽心尽力去做。\n",
      "你问到个人经历，也问到-讲到安徽。我曾经是安徽凤阳的插队知青，很难忘啊那一段和乡亲们度过的艰难岁月。那里当时是中国农村出了名的穷地方，也是后来呀中国农村承包制改革的发源地。我还记得77年高考后啊，我是在田头锄地时得到高考录取通知消息的。正是改革开放改变了我们国家的命运，使亿万农民-啊亿万农民脱贫啊，也使许许多多的人出现了重大的人生转折。现在改革的重任落到了我们这一代肩上，我想啊要尽力使改革的红利惠及全体人民，使老年人安度晚年、年轻人充满希望，使我们的国家生机勃勃。\n",
      "没有更多的时间啊来讲述我个人的经历，啊我想说的是，在我的个人经历，读书、做事、文化熏陶当中啊，悟出一个道理，就是行大道、民为本、利天下。这九个字啊不是什么典籍的原话，是我的心得。我坚信做人要正、办事要公，才能利国利民。谢谢。\n",
      "嗯时间关系，是不是再提一个问题？\n",
      "尊重主持人，也是尊重女性，尊重记者。\n",
      "中区第一排中间俄新社。\n",
      "呃总理，您好。我是俄罗斯新闻社的记者。你刚才说呃中美关系的问题，我不能不问呃中俄关系。Um呃中国国家主席呃习近平即将访问俄罗斯，您呃作为新一届呃总理，怎么评价中俄关系？Um将在哪一些方面推动呃中俄合作？谢谢。\n",
      "呃不久啊习近平主席将访问俄罗斯，这本身就说明中俄关系的重要性。我们两国互为啊最大的邻国。我还记得去年访问俄罗斯，俄罗斯的领导人啊和我会面的时候，直截了当，说我们之间的政治关系很好了，没有什么谈不拢的，大家是不是多用点精力谈务实合作的事。我在和俄罗斯的地方民间人士接触过程当中啊，也深感他们迫切希望能够提升中俄务实合作的水平，发挥啊中俄经贸互补的优势。我还记得出席一个经贸方面的论坛，当时我说，也确实如此。中俄双边贸易额啊是800亿美元，我就憧憬啊，我们共同努力，再翻几番没有问题，而且可以实现共赢。\n",
      "中俄推动务实合作啊，在地区和国际事务中加强沟通协调，不仅有利于啊巩固双边关系，而且有利于维护地区和世界的和平和稳定。呃中国事实上啊和周边国家一直在啊推动互利合作、互利共赢、发挥互相优势的关系啊迈上新的台阶，使我们的亚洲亚太地区和平发展、合作成为不可阻挡的潮流。\n",
      "因为刚才主持人说这是最后一个问题了，啊今天在场的有很多来自国外的记者朋友没有机会一一提问，我想呢再讲几句。呃这一段时间啊，我一直在看有关中国问题的报道，当然主要是国际舆论所关注的一些问题，大概主要是两方面：一个是担心中国经济能不能够持续发展；还有一个呢是担心啊中国发展起来会不会恃强称霸。\n",
      "这两种疑论-疑问那我认为都可以打消。中国有条件保持经济持续健康发展，不断推进社会进步。中国有13多亿人口，实现现代化还有很长的路要走，需要持久的世界和平环境。即使中国发展强大起来，我们也不会称霸，因为中国啊在近现代历史的惨痛遭遇当中啊有感受，己所不欲，勿施于人，这是中国人的信条。\n",
      "呃这里我想强调，走和平发展道路是中国坚定不移的决心，维护国家的主权和领土完整，也是中国不可动摇的意志。这两条原则并行不悖，也符合啊维护地区稳定和世界和平秩序的规则。中国啊作为发展中的大国，愿意承担相应的国际义务，和世界各国一道，携手努力，守住21世纪的全球和平、繁荣扩大。谢谢各位。\n",
      "啊刚才主持人又向我这个“示表”了，时间到了。啊我知道啊许多人可能很早就来到这里了，呃如果说没有新闻记者的话，这个世界上就没有新闻了。你们很辛苦，也请啊保重，啊我们还有机会再见。\n",
      "再次谢谢各位，再见。\n"

      "请允许我首先介绍一下几位新当选的副总理。这位是黄菊同志。 1\n",
      "这位是吴仪同志。 1\n",
      "这位是曾培炎同志。 1\n",
      "这位是回良玉同志。 1\n",
      "四位副总理呀，比我大的有三位，年龄比我大的有三位。其中有一位女副副总理，她为我们今天的讲台呀增加了一点鲜艳的色彩。 1\n",
      "请大家原谅，首先啊我要对全国人民讲几句话。 1\n",
      "感谢人民对我的信任，我是一个很普通的人。我出生在农村的一个教育世家。 1\n",
      "我从在大学学地质到从事地质工作，整整25年。这期间大部分是在非常艰苦和恶劣的条件中度过的。我深知啊，人生的艰辛，也知道国家建设的艰难。但我也树立一种信心，一个人、一个民族、一个国家，只要不畏艰险，勇于攀登，一定能达到光辉的顶点。 1\n",
      "我在中南海工作了18年，这是我们国家现代化建设十分重要的一个时期。我亲眼目睹了在邓小平同志和江泽民同志的领导下，中国改革开放和现代化建设所取得的巨大成就，中国面貌发生的历史性变化。中国的建设事业是非常伟大也非常艰巨的，惟有在党的领导下，坚持改革开放，走有中国特色社会主义道路，国家才能繁荣富强；惟有民主、科学和负责任的精神才能实现我们的目标。全国2500个县区啊，我跑遍了1800个。 1\n",
      "现在我愿意回答大家提出的问题。 1\n",
      "谢谢。温总理您好，我是中央电视台记者**。呃首先向您祝贺当选为本届政府的总理，同时也为嗯昨天新当选的四位嗯副总理呢表示祝贺。温总理，我们知道您也是上届政府的主要领导人之一。那么请问您对上届政府的工作，以及对朱镕基总理本人的工作有何评价？过去的五年中国取得了举世瞩目的成就，那么也对本届政府呢也就它的工作提出了更高的要求，请问温总理，您认为本届政府所面临的主要的困难和挑战是什么？谢谢。 1\n",
      "以江泽民同志啊为核心的第三代领导集体，为中国的改革、发展、稳定作出了举世公认的重大贡献，并且在实验中形成了“三个代表”的重要思想理论，这是我们一笔宝贵的财富。上届政府在朱镕基总理的领导下，忠实地履行职责，做了大量富有成效的工作，人民对此是满意的。 1\n",
      "我们现在的全部工作都是在前任的基础上开始的。要居安思危，有备无患。我总记得一句古训：生于忧患，死于安乐。前人给我们奠定了很好的基础，但是摆在我们面前还有许多困难和问题，还要我们继续进行开创式的工作。 1\n",
      "我想，当前摆在我们面前的主要问题，第一，农业发展滞后，农民收入增长缓慢，已经成为制约扩大内需的一个重要因素。 1\n",
      "一部分企业经营困难，建立现代企业制度将是一个长期的任务。这是第二个。 1\n",
      "下岗-第三下岗和失业人口不断增加，社会保障的压力非常之大。 1\n",
      "第四，城乡发展不平衡，东西发展不平衡，还有相当一部分地区、相当一部分人口处于贫困状态。 1\n",
      "第五，财政负担沉重，金融不良资产比例较多。 1\n",
      "但是我们有改革开放20多年来奠定的雄厚物质技术基础，有安定团结的政治局面，只要坚持正确的路线和政策，我相信在以胡锦涛总书记啊胡锦涛啊为总书记的党中央领导下，我们一定能够克服困难，实现全面建设小康的宏伟目标。 1\n",
      "下一个问题。好第三排，德新社的那位记者。 1\n",
      "嗯我是德新社。呃朱镕基开始当总理的时候，他说不管前面是地雷阵还是万丈深渊，我都将鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已。那跟他比起来，你觉得你的工作风格会怎么样？谢谢。 1\n",
      "朱镕基总理呀是我非常敬佩的一个领导人，他有许多优点值得我学习。 1\n",
      "至于我自己，大家普遍认为我是一个温和的人。 1\n",
      "但同时，我是我又是一个有信念、有主见、敢负责的人。 1\n",
      "在我当选以后啊，我心里总默念着林则徐的两句诗：苟利国家生死以，岂因避-祸福避趋之啊。 1\n",
      "这就是我今后工作的态度。 1\n",
      "好，下一个问题。 1\n",
      "啊总理您好，我是人民日报社记者。呃刚才您谈到就是说新一届政府呢面临的任务仍然非常艰巨。啊那么还特别是呢新一届政府呢还面临着担负着这个全面建设小康社会开好局的任务，应该说担子非常重。所以请问总理呢，呃我们新一届政府呃在这个五年任期当中啊，制定准备制定什么样的目标和施政纲领？谢谢。 1\n",
      "我认为这是一个总理今天应该认真回答的一个重大问题。 1\n",
      "我曾经啊把今后的工作概括为四句话。 1\n",
      "第一啊，实现一个目标，这就是保持经济持续较快地增长，同时，不断改善人民的生活水平。做到这点，就要继续保持政策的稳定性和连续性，坚持扩大内需的方针，实施积极的财政政策。 1\n",
      "第二，抓住两个关键环节。一是经济结构的战略性调整，一是继续扩大对外开放。 1\n",
      "第三，解决好三个重大的经济问题。第一个问题是就业和社会保障。第二个问题是财政的增收节支。第三个问题是继续整顿和规范市场经济秩序。 1\n",
      "第四句话啊，推进四项改革。第一项改革是农村改革。农村改革啊包括农村税费改革，粮食购销体制改革，对农民补贴方式的改革，农村金融改革和农村医疗制度的改革。 1\n",
      "第二是企业改革。继续把企业改革作为整个经济体制改革的中心环节，致力于建立现代企业制度的目标，同时，推进国有资产管理体制的改革。 1\n",
      "第三金融改革。一方面建立和完善金融监管体制，一方面要加快国有企业的改革，使其建立起真正的现代金融企业制度。 1\n",
      "第四政府机构改革。这个方案大家都已经知道，关键在政府职能的转变，成败与否在此一举。 1\n",
      "这四句话大家可能啊都已经熟悉了。我又想了24个字，就是为了保证我这些任务的完成，必须把握以下几个原则。 1\n",
      "城乡协调、东西互动、内外交流、上下结合、远近兼顾、松紧适度。 1\n",
      "城乡结合，就是要把农业和农村作为重中之重，促进城乡协调发展。 1\n",
      "东西互动，就是东部地区要抓住机遇，加快发展，率先实现现代化。要要把老工业基地的改组、改造和振兴摆在更加突出的位置。继续实施西部大开发的战略。 1\n",
      "内外交流，就是要坚持以扩大内需为主，同时抓住加入世贸组织的大好机遇，继续推进对外开放。 1\n",
      "上下结合，就是要充分发挥中央和地方两个积极性。 1\n",
      "远近兼顾，就是要继续实施科教兴国和可持续发展的战略，使我们国家的经济和社会保持可持续发展。 1\n",
      "松紧适度啊，就是要使发展的速度、改革的力度和社会可承受的程度啊相适应。保持改革、发展和稳定的结合。 1\n",

      "温总理，您好，我是香港东方报业集团记者***。首先祝贺你当选国务院总理。呃来来自香港的记者我们很想知道在座诸位副总理当中，有哪一位会协助你分管港澳事务，我们也很想知道新一届政府对香港的政策会不会改变。目前香港财政赤字严重，失业率也很高，无论特区政府也好，呃香港市民也好，都在努力度过难关。请问中央政府会不会采取进一步措施支持香港更快度过难关？此外我想问一下，你什么时候位 1\n",

      "香港回归5年多来，在香港行政长官董建华和特区政府的领导下，认真贯彻执行了“一国两制”的方针和《基本法》的原则，维护了香港同胞法律赋予的自由和权利。香港战胜了亚洲风波带来的经济上的困难，保持了稳定和发展。 1\n",
      "毋庸讳言，香港目前经济确实遇到比较大的困难，主要表现在失业率增高和财政赤字加大。这既有国际经济形势变化的影响，也有香港自身经济结构的问题。 1\n",

      "你好，温总理，嗯有一个问题，江泽民和朱镕基说解决这个失业问题，有一个方式是啊，国家应该就是让这些民间企业、私营企业，啊给他们一些优惠的政策。你可以给我们一个介绍一下有有什么样的优惠政策来给这些呃私营企业？呃还有一个问题，就是中国有没有一个计划来啊啊扩大这个人民币的浮动范围？谢谢。 1\n",
      "发展个体私营企业等非公有制经济，是我们政府坚定不移地的方针。 1\n",
      "只要是依法经营，照章纳税，维护职工的合法权益，并且符合安全和环保的要求，我们支持和鼓励个体私营企业发展，这是扩大就业的一个非常重要的渠道。 1\n",
      "我们将在市场准入、税收、贷款和进出口等方面，给个体私营企业以平等的待遇。 1\n",

      "谢谢总理，我是新华社记者。最近呢我们注意到，海外一些媒体呢有这样两种说法，一种说法是我国经济体制改革近年来呢取得了明显的成果。但与经济体制改革相比呢，政治体制改革的步伐相对缓慢。另一种说法认为呢，我国反腐败工作，越反腐败案件越多，涉案的政府官员呢级别越来越高，金额越来越大。那么我想问总理，您对这两种说法有何评价？新一届政府将采取哪些措施推动我国政治体制改革进一步深化？对建立清正廉洁高效的政府，您有何设想？谢谢。 1\n",

      "第二，依法行政。政府部门和公务人员都要按照宪法和法律执行公务，同时又要接受宪法和法律的约束和规范。 1\n",

      "说起台湾我就很动情，啊，这就不由得使我想起了一位辛亥革命的老人、国民党的一位元老于右任在他临终前写过一首哀歌。 1\n",
      "“葬我于高山上兮，望我大陆。大陆不可见兮，唯有痛哭。葬我于高山上兮，望我家乡。家乡不可见兮，不能相望。天苍苍，野茫茫，山之上，国有殇。”这是多么震撼整个中华民族的诗句。 1\n",
      "中国政府啊将坚定不移地执行和平统一、一国两制方针。在一个中国前-在一个中国基础上，尽早恢复两岸的对话与谈判，反对“台独”。 1\n",

      "80年代末90年代初，世界风云变幻，苏联巨变-苏联解体，东欧巨变，在中国也发生了一场政治风波。党和政府紧紧依靠人民，采取果断措施，稳定了国内局势。并且继续推进改革开放，走有中国特色社会主义道路。13年来，中国所取得的巨大成就说明，稳定是至关重要的。 1\n",

      "主动的配合国际组织啊搞好武器的核查工作，彻底销毁大规模杀伤性武器。 1\n",
      "现在伊拉克的局势啊已经箭在弦上，一触即发。但是只要有一点希望，我们仍旧不放弃通过政治和平解决的努力。 1\n",
      "下一个问题。 1\n",
      "总理您好，我是中央人民广播电台的记者。农村税费改革今年将在全国全面推开。您曾经说过，我们一定会走出历史上所谓“黄宗曦-黄宗曦定律”这个怪圈。请问您认为我们的税费改革怎么才能走出这个怪圈？谢谢。 1\n",
      "这个问题我讲的已经很多了。我想强调两点。第一，农村税费改革的实质，是要改革农村不适宜生产力发展的上层建筑的某些环节，最重要的是要精简人员。 1\n",
      "中国 1\n",
      "与此同时，要加大财政对农村的支持力度。我们的最终目标是要把一切不应该向农民收取的税费，全部减下来，但这需要一个过程。 1\n",

      "出现亚洲金融风波，GDP的增长平均在7.7%，去年达到8%。中国的外汇储备达到3000亿等等，这些是使我高兴的。 1\n",

      "中国每年新增劳动力1000万，中国的下岗和失业人口大约1400万。 1\n",
      "进城的农民工啊一般保持在1亿2千万。 1\n",
      "中国面临巨大的就业压力。中国13亿人口有9亿农民，说是目前没有摆脱贫困的是3000万左右。但是大家知道，这是低水平的，人均625块。 1\n",
      "如果标准再增加200块，中国的贫困人口就是9000万。 1\n",
      "中国东西差距很大，大家恐怕只是从概念上有，我想说一个数字，中国沿海五六个省市GDP的总值超过50%。 1\n",

And we are also very fortunate to have one female Vice premier who actually as you can see add color and light to um what we can see on the podium.</text>, <text>请大家原谅，首先啊我要对全国人民讲几句话。</text>, <text>Before I take your questions，please allow me to use this opportunity to first say a few words to people across the country.</text>, <text>感谢人民对我的信任，我是一个很普通的人。我出生在农村的一个教育世家。</text>, <text>我的祖父、父亲和母亲都是教员。我的孩提时代是在战乱中度过的。战火啊烧毁了我的全家，包括爷爷亲手办得那座小学。旧中国的苦难在我幼小的心灵留下不可磨灭的印象。</text>, <text>I want to thank the Chinese people for the great trust you place on me. I am a very ordinary person. I come from a family of teachers in the countryside. My grandfather, my father and my mother were all teachers. My childhood was spent in turmoil of war. Our home was literally burnt down by the flame of war </text>, <text>and so was the primary school, which my grandfather built with his own hands. The untold suffering in the days of old China left an indelible imprint on my tender mind</text>, <text>我从在大学学地质到从事地质工作，整整25年。这期间大部分是在非常艰苦和恶劣的条件中度过的。我深知啊，人生的艰辛，也知道国家建设的艰难。但我也树立一种信心，一个人、一个民族、一个国家，只要不畏艰险，勇于攀登，一定能达到光辉的顶点。</text>, <text>Since becoming a university student majoring in geology, I spent a full 25 years in the geological field. A good part of it was spent under very tough and harsh conditions. That experience let me know keenly how hard life could be and how demanding a job it was to build up our country. But more importantly, that experience filled me with confidence. I firmly believe that be it a person, a nation or a country, so long as they dare to brave hardships and dangers and not dread a fatiguing climb, they will eventually reach the luminous summit.</text>, <text>我在中南海工作了18年，这是我们国家现代化建设十分重要的一个时期。我亲眼目睹了在邓小平同志和江泽民同志的领导下，中国改革开放和现代化建设所取得的巨大成就，中国面貌发生的历史性变化。中国的建设事业是非常伟大也非常艰巨的，惟有在党的领导下，坚持改革开放，走有中国特色社会主义道路，国家才能繁荣富强；惟有民主、科学和负责任的精神才能实现我们的目标。全国2500个县区啊，我跑遍了1800个。</text>, <text>这使我更深的了解了国情和人民的状况，我深知人民的期待，我绝不辜负人民的期望。一定要以人民给我的信心、勇气和力量，忠实地履行宪法赋予我的职责，殚精竭虑，鞠躬尽瘁，不负重望。</text>, <text>I’ve been working in Zhongnanhai for 18 years, which </text>, <text>was an important period in China’s reform, opening-up and modernization. I’ve seen with my own eyes, under the leadership of comrades Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin, China has made remarkable achievements in its reform and opening-up programs and China has undergone a historic transformation. China’s development is a project that is extremely great and demanding. Only through reform, opening-up and building socialism with Chinese characteristics under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party can we succeed and bring about a strong and prosperous China. And only by adhering to a democratic, scientific and responsible spirit can we achieve our objectives. I’ve been to 1,800 out of a total of 2,500 counties in China, which enable me to better know our national conditions and our people’s lives. I know what they expect and what their expectations are. I will live up to their trust. And I will use the confidence, resolve and strength I’ve gained from the people to perform my solemn constitutional duties as the premier. I will exert all my strength and wisdom I will dedicate myself completely to the service of the country and do everything possible to live up to the people’s expectations.</text>, <text>现在我愿意回答大家提出的问题。</text>, <text>Now I would be happy to take your questions.</text>, <text>谢谢。温总理您好，我是中央电视台记者**。呃首先向您祝贺当选为本届政府的总理，同时也为嗯昨天新当选的四位嗯副总理呢表示祝贺。温总理，我们知道您也是上届政府的主要领导人之一。那么请问您对上届政府的工作，以及对朱镕基总理本人的工作有何评价？过去的五年中国取得了举世瞩目的成就，那么也对本届政府呢也就它的工作提出了更高的要求，请问温总理，您认为本届政府所面临的主要的困难和挑战是什么？谢谢。</text>, <text>I’m from CCTV. First of all, many congratulations to you, Premier Wen, on your election as the premier. And our warm congratulations also go to the vice premiers. We know you were one of the leading officials of previous governments. Over the past five years, China has accomplished a lot. So we would like to have your comment on work of the previous government and of Premier Zhu Rongji himself. And with the achievements in the past five years, you now face a more demanding job in developing the economy even further. So what do you think are the major difficulties and challenges for the new government?</text>, <text>以江泽民同志啊为核心的第三代领导集体，为中国的改革、发展、稳定作出了举世公认的重大贡献，并且在实验中形成了“三个代表”的重要思想理论，这是我们一笔宝贵的财富。上届政府在朱镕基总理的领导下，忠实地履行职责，做了大量富有成效的工作，人民对此是满意的。</text>, <text>The third generation of Chinese leadership with comrade Jiang Zemin at its core have made enormous and universally recognized </text>, <text>contribution to China’s reform, development and stability and have, through practice, formed the important thought of the Three Represents, which is a valuable spiritual </text>, <text>asset. The previous government under the leadership of Premier Zhu faithfully performed their duties and did a huge amount of remarkable work. The public </text>, <text>were satisfied with what they have done.</text>, <text>我们现在的全部工作都是在前任的基础上开始的。要居安思危，有备无患。我总记得一句古训：生于忧患，死于安乐。前人给我们奠定了很好的基础，但是摆在我们面前还有许多困难和问题，还要我们继续进行开创式的工作。</text>, <text>All of our work will have to be built on what our predecessors have achieved. We will have to be mindful of possible adversities and be prepared for the worst. Actually, I always pay a lot of attention to the ancient motto, that is, one prospers in worries and hardships and perishes in ease and comfort. So our predecessors have already laid a very good foundation for us. Yet we are still faced with numerous difficulties and problems ahead, which requires innovation and creativity as we press ahead.</text>, <text>我想，当前摆在我们面前的主要问题，第一，农业发展滞后，农民收入增长缓慢，已经成为制约扩大内需的一个重要因素。</text>, <text>First of the major problems we are faced with is the uh backward development of agriculture and the slow increase of farmers’ income. This has seriously constrained the expansion of China’s domestic demand.</text>, <text>一部分企业经营困难，建立现代企业制度将是一个长期的任务。这是第二个。</text>, <text>Second, some enterprises face difficulties in their business operation and the establishment of modern corporate system will be a long-term task.</text>, <text>下岗-第三下岗和失业人口不断增加，社会保障的压力非常之大。</text>, <text>Third, the number of laid-off and unemployed workers keeps going up, causing tremendous pressure on the social security system.</text>, <text>第四，城乡发展不平衡，东西发展不平衡，还有相当一部分地区、相当一部分人口处于贫困状态。</text>, <text>Fourth, uneven development between the urban and rural areas and between the eastern and western regions in this country. There are still quite many regions and population under poverty.</text>, <text>第五，财政负担沉重，金融不良资产比例较多。</text>, <text>Fifth, financial burden is heavy and the proportion of non-performing assets or non-performing loans is quite high.</text>, <text>但是我们有改革开放20多年来奠定的雄厚物质技术基础，有安定团结的政治局面，只要坚持正确的路线和政策，我相信在以胡锦涛总书记啊胡锦涛啊为总书记的党中央领导下，我们一定能够克服困难，实现全面建设小康的宏伟目标。</text>, <text>Nevertheless, we have, after all, already built a strong material and technological basis </text>, <text>as the result of 20 years of reform and opening-up. So long as we have the right policies and guidelines, I am confident that under the leadership of CPC Central Committee with Comrade Hu Jintao as General Secretary, we will surely overcome all the difficulties and achieve the grand objective of building a well-off society in an all-round way.</text>, <text>下一个问题。好第三排，德新社的那位记者。</text>, <text>n/i</text>, <text>嗯我是德新社。呃朱镕基开始当总理的时候，他说不管前面是地雷阵还是万丈深渊，我都将鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已。那跟他比起来，你觉得你的工作风格会怎么样？谢谢。</text>, <text>I’m from DPA. When Premier Zhu Rongji just become the premier, he said that whatever lies ahead, be it uh a field of landmines or an unfathomable abiss </text>, <text>, he will exerts all his efforts and contribute all his best to the country till the last minute of his life. Compared to his working style, what are the features of your working style? </text>, <text>朱镕基总理呀是我非常敬佩的一个领导人，他有许多优点值得我学习。</text>, <text>I have a lot of respects for Premier Zhu. He has many strong points that I need to learn from him.</text>, <text>至于我自己，大家普遍认为我是一个温和的人。</text>, <text>As for myself, it is generally believed that I am quite mild-tempered.</text>, <text>但同时，我是我又是一个有信念、有主见、敢负责的人。</text>, <text>But at the same time, I am someone who deeply believes in his conviction, who holds his ground if it is consistent with principle and who is confident and courageous enough to take up his responsibility.</text>, <text>在我当选以后啊，我心里总默念着林则徐的两句诗：苟利国家生死以，岂因避-祸福避趋之啊。</text>, <text>Since I became the premier, I have been whispering two lines written by Lin Zexu </text>, <text>to myself and they are: I will do whatever it takes to serve my country, even at the cost of my own life, regardless of fortune or misfortune to myself.</text>, <text>这就是我今后工作的态度。</text>, <text>So this will be the attitude in which I will start my work</text>, <text>好，下一个问题。</text>, <text>n/i</text>, <text>啊总理您好，我是人民日报社记者。呃刚才您谈到就是说新一届政府呢面临的任务仍然非常艰巨。啊那么还特别是呢新一届政府呢还面临着担负着这个全面建设小康社会开好局的任务，应该说担子非常重。所以请问总理呢，呃我们新一届政府呃在这个五年任期当中啊，制定准备制定什么样的目标和施政纲领？谢谢。</text>, <text>I’m from People’s Daily. Just now you mentioned that the task for the new government would be very daunting. True, the new government will shoulder heavy responsibilities, because it will strive to make a good beginning in the endeavor to build a well-off society in all-round way. So my question is what will be the objective and program for the new government in the coming five years’ time?</text>, <text>我认为这是一个总理今天应该认真回答的一个重大问题。</text>, <text>You have raised a very important issue that as a premier I will have to answer very seriously.</text>, <text>我曾经啊把今后的工作概括为四句话。</text>, <text>For once, I made an attempt </text>, <text>to summarize our future work in four sentences.</text>, <text>第一啊，实现一个目标，这就是保持经济持续较快地增长，同时，不断改善人民的生活水平。做到这点，就要继续保持政策的稳定性和连续性，坚持扩大内需的方针，实施积极的财政政策。</text>, <text>First, to strive to achieve one objective, that is, to maintain steady and rapid economic growth and continuously improve people’s living standards. To this end, we’ll have to ensure the continuity and consistency of our policies, and continue to stimulate domestic demand and adopt a proactive fiscal policy.</text>, <text>第二，抓住两个关键环节。一是经济结构的战略性调整，一是继续扩大对外开放。 </text>, <text>Second, to strive to grasp two crucial links, namely, to continue to advance strategic restructuring of our economy and to continue to open China wider to the outside world.</text>, <text>第三，解决好三个重大的经济问题。第一个问题是就业和社会保障。第二个问题是财政的增收节支。第三个问题是继续整顿和规范市场经济秩序。</text>, <text>Third, strive to tackle three major problems in our economic life, and they are, first, employment and social security system, second, to increase revenue and reduce expenditure, and third, to continue with our effort to rectify and standardize market economic order</text>, <text>说完了？</text>, <text>还有四。</text>, <text>说完了？</text>, <text>n/i</text>, <text>说完了？</text>, <text>啊。嗯。</text>, <text>第四句话啊，推进四项改革。第一项改革是农村改革。农村改革啊包括农村税费改革，粮食购销体制改革，对农民补贴方式的改革，农村金融改革和农村医疗制度的改革。</text>, <text>Four, to advance reform in four areas, and the first area is rural reform. Rural reform includes tax-for-fee reform, grain distribution system reform, reform in the way farmers are subsidized, and rural financial reform as well as rural medicare system reform.</text>, <text>第二是企业改革。继续把企业改革作为整个经济体制改革的中心环节，致力于建立现代企业制度的目标，同时，推进国有资产管理体制的改革。</text>, <text>The second area is enterprise reform. Enterprise reform will be taken as our central task in economic reform, and we are committed to establish a modern corporate system while at the same time deepening our reform in state assets management.</text>, <text>第三金融改革。一方面建立和完善金融监管体制，一方面要加快国有企业的改革，使其建立起真正的现代金融企业制度。</text>, <text>The third area is financial reform. On the one hand, we need to establish and improve the regulatory system for the financial sector, and at the same time we need to accelerate our reform of the state-owned commercial banks, so that they can genuinely become modern financial institutions.</text>, <text>第四政府机构改革。这个方案大家都已经知道，关键在政府职能的转变，成败与否在此一举。</text>, <text>Fourth is the institutional reform of the government. The plan of the reform has been made well known to you all. I think this reform is actually a make-or-break reform for the transformation of the functions of the government.</text>, <text>这四句话大家可能啊都已经熟悉了。我又想了24个字，就是为了保证我这些任务的完成，必须把握以下几个原则。</text>, <text>So now you are familiar with these four sentences. In order to ensure that these objectives are met and fulfilled, we need to follow the following principles, which can be described in twenty-four Chinese characters.</text>, <text>城乡协调、东西互动、内外交流、上下结合、远近兼顾、松紧适度。</text>, <text>And these twenty-four characters are: coordinating urban and rural developments, east-west interaction, domestic demand plus external opening-up, combining central and local initiatives, balancing long-term and medium interests and an appropriate degree of intensity.</text>, <text>城乡结合，就是要把农业和农村作为重中之重，促进城乡协调发展。</text>, <text>To be specific, by coordinating urban and rural developments, I mean that agriculture and rural development should be taken as priority among priorities in order to achieve a coordinated development between the urban and rural areas.</text>, <text>东西互动，就是东部地区要抓住机遇，加快发展，率先实现现代化。要要把老工业基地的改组、改造和振兴摆在更加突出的位置。继续实施西部大开发的战略。 </text>, <text>By east-west interaction, I mean that the coastal region in the east should seize  opportunity to accelerate development and be the first to achieve modernization. More emphasis will be placed on the readjustment, transformation and rejuvenation of China’s old industrial bases and we will continue to make efforts to press ahead with the country’s west development strategy.</text>, <text>内外交流，就是要坚持以扩大内需为主，同时抓住加入世贸组织的大好机遇，继续推进对外开放。</text>, <text>By domestic demand plus external opening-up,</text>, <text>I mean that we will continue to mainly pursue the policy of expanding domestic demand while opening China still wider to the outside world by seizing the wonderful opportunity presented with Chinese WTO membership.</text>, <text>上下结合，就是要充分发挥中央和地方两个积极性。</text>, <text>By combining central and local initiatives I mean that we should bring into full play the enthusiasm of both the central government and localities.</text>, <text>远近兼顾，就是要继续实施科教兴国和可持续发展的战略，使我们国家的经济和社会保持可持续发展。</text>, <text>By balancing long-term and medium interests, I mean that we will continue to pursue the policy of revitalizing our country through science and education and to carry out the strategy of sustainable development so that China’s economic and social development will always be sustained.</text>, <text>松紧适度啊，就是要使发展的速度、改革的力度和社会可承受的程度啊相适应。保持改革、发展和稳定的结合。</text>, <text>Finally, by an appropriate degree of intensity, I mean that we need to balance the speed of development and the intensity of reform against the resilience of the public and properly handle the relations among reform, development and stability</text>, <text>n/i</text>, <text>温总理，您好，我是香港东方报业集团记者***。首先祝贺你当选国务院总理。呃来来自香港的记者我们很想知道在座诸位副总理当中，有哪一位会协助你分管港澳事务，我们也很想知道新一届政府对香港的政策会不会改变。目前香港财政赤字严重，失业率也很高，无论特区政府也好，呃香港市民也好，都在努力度过难关。请问中央政府会不会采取进一步措施支持香港更快度过难关？此外我想问一下，你什么时候位</text>, <text>临香港亲自为我们打打气，我相信香港市民一定会很欢迎的。谢谢。</text>, <text>I’m from er Hong Kong: First of all, lots of congratulations. Correspondents from Hong Kong are very interested to know who, among the four vice premiers, will have in their portfolio the er Hong Kong and Macao affairs? We would also like to know, will there be any change in the new government’s policy towards Hong Kong? At the moment, Hong Kong runs a high fiscal deficit, and unemployment rate is going up, the Hong Kong SAR government as well as the residents in Hong Kong are all trying very hard to weather through the difficult period. What measures would the central government adopt to further support the Hong Kong SAR government and Hong Kong people to get over the difficulties? And the last question is when do you plan to visit Hong Kong to encourage the people of Hong Kong </text>, <text>to overcome their difficulties? I am sure you will be most welcome there.</text>, <text>感谢你的提问，使我有机会第一次通过新闻媒体向广大香港同胞、澳门同胞表示我亲切的问候和良好的祝愿。</text>, <text>Thank you for your question. Your question gives me the opportunity to extend for the first time through media my best wishes and most cordial greetings toward Hong Kong and Macao compatriots.</text>, <text>香港回归5年多来，在香港行政长官董建华和特区政府的领导下，认真贯彻执行了“一国两制”的方针和《基本法》的原则，维护了香港同胞法律赋予的自由和权利。香港战胜了亚洲风波带来的经济上的困难，保持了稳定和发展。</text>, <text>Over the past five years and more, the Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa and the Hong Kong SAR government have very well implemented the basic policy of “One Country, Two Systems” as well as the principles enshrined in the Basic Law. As the result, they have safeguarded well the freedom and rights enjoyed by Hong Kong compatriots according to law. Hong Kong has also successfully overcome the economic difficulties caused by the Asian financial crisis and has maintained stability and development.</text>, <text>毋庸讳言，香港目前经济确实遇到比较大的困难，主要表现在失业率增高和财政赤字加大。这既有国际经济形势变化的影响，也有香港自身经济结构的问题。</text>, <text>There is no doubt that at the moment, Hong Kong is suffering from major difficulties: the unemployment rate is going up, and fiscal deficit is increasing. This has to do with the changes in the world economic situation. It also has to do with the own structural problems in Hong Kong economy.</text>, <text>但是香港的优势还在，香港有雄厚的物质基础，直到目前，香港没有一笔内债和外债，香港的居民储蓄率还超过1997年。</text>, <text>Nevertheless, Hong Kong’s advantages are still there. Hong Kong enjoys a strong material base. Up to now, Hong Kong has incurred no debt both internal and external, and household savings rate is higher than er the uh savings rate in 1997.</text>, <text>香港有完备的法制，有有利的区位优势，有许多优秀的管理人才，现在需要的是团结和信心。</text>, <text>Hong Kong enjoys a comprehensive legal framework. Hong Kong also enjoys advantages in its geographical location. Hong Kong is also blessed with a large group of people with management expertise. So what Hong Kong needs now, more than anything else, is unity and confidence.</text>, <text>我完全相信香港人民的智慧和能力，在以董建华为首的特区政府的领导下，一定能够克服眼前的困难。至于，说到中央政府对香港的支持，我想明确表示，我们将一如既往、竭尽全力支持香港的稳定和发展。我们正在抓紧落实内地与香港特别行政区建立更加紧密的经贸关系的各项措施。</text>, <text>I have every confidence in the wisdom and ability of the people of Hong Kong. I’m confident that under the leadership of the Hong Kong SAR government led by Mr. Tung Chee-hwa, Hong Kong will surely surmount its temporary difficulties. As for the support from the central government to Hong Kong, here I wish to state in clear-cut terms that the central government will, as always, continue to give support to Hong Kong to ensure its stability and development. As a matter of the fact, we are losing no time in bringing about the arrangement for closer economic ties and trade between the mainland and Hong Kong.</text>, <text>香港是中国的一颗璀璨的明珠，保持香港的稳定和繁荣是我们坚定不移的目标，也是中央政府的责任，义不容辞的责任。</text>, <text>Hong Kong is a splendid pearl of China. To maintain Hong Kong’s stability and prosperity is our firm objective. It is also what the responsibility of the central government dictates, so the central government is duty-bound to make that happen.</text>, <text>我希望早一天到香港，越快越好。</text>, <text>I hope to visit Hong Kong very soon; the sooner, the better.</text>, <text>第六排，布隆博格金融新闻社。</text>, <text>n/i</text>, <text>你好，温总理，嗯有一个问题，江泽民和朱镕基说解决这个失业问题，有一个方式是啊，国家应该就是让这些民间企业、私营企业，啊给他们一些优惠的政策。你可以给我们一个介绍一下有有什么样的优惠政策来给这些呃私营企业？呃还有一个问题，就是中国有没有一个计划来啊啊扩大这个人民币的浮动范围？谢谢。</text>, <text>I’m from uh Bloomberg Financial News. According to er Mr. Jiang and Mr. Zhu Rongji</text>, <text>, one way to tackle China's unemployment problem is to offer preferential policies to the private enterprises. Could you tell us what will be the preferential policies for these enterprises? And could you also kindly shed light on if China has any plan to widen the band in which the value of RMB fluctuates?</text>, <text>发展个体私营企业等非公有制经济，是我们政府坚定不移地的方针。</text>, <text>The government has set a policy-a firm policy to develop the non-public sectors, including the uh individually-owned and privately-run enterprises.</text>, <text>只要是依法经营，照章纳税，维护职工的合法权益，并且符合安全和环保的要求，我们支持和鼓励个体私营企业发展，这是扩大就业的一个非常重要的渠道。</text>, <text>So long as these enterprises operate in accordance with law, pay taxes in accordance with regulation, as long as their enterprises meet the safety and environmental standards, and safeguard the rights and interests-the legitimate rights and interests of their employees, the government would give them support and actually encourage their growth because their development will be very important for the creation of more job opportunities.</text>, <text>我们将在市场准入、税收、贷款和进出口等方面，给个体私营企业以平等的待遇。</text>, <text>We would ensure a level playing field. In that level playing field, the uh individually-owned and privately-run enterprises </text>, <text>would get the same treatment when it comes to market access, taxation, loan application, and import and export businesses.</text>, <text>至于你提到的汇率问题，中国实行的是根据市场需求变化、有管理的浮动汇率。</text>, <text>You also asked the question about the exchange rate of our </text>, <text>currency. The practice of China now is regulated floating rate which is based on the changes in market demand and supply.</text>, <text>从1994年汇率并轨开始，到现在人民币的汇率并不是一成不变的。人民币兑美元的实际汇率啊增长了增值了18%，对欧元增长了34%。</text>, <text>We uh integrated the two-track exchange rate in 1994. Our rate has not remained unchanged since then. As a matter of fact, in real terms, the value of RMB has appreciated against US Dollar by 18%, and has appreciated by 34% against Euro.</text>, <text>我们将继续探索、完善汇率形成的机制，但是我想给各位说明一点，人民币的强劲和稳定不仅有利于中国，也有利于亚洲和世界。</text>, <text>We will continue to explore approaches and work to improve the mechanism under which the exchange rate is determined. Here I want to make one explanation. A strong and stable RMB Yuan is not only in China's own interests, it is also a blessing for Asia and the world at large.</text>, <text>谢谢。***</text>, <text>Thank you.</text>, <text>谢谢总理，我是新华社记者。最近呢我们注意到，海外一些媒体呢有这样两种说法，一种说法是我国经济体制改革近年来呢取得了明显的成果。但与经济体制改革相比呢，政治体制改革的步伐相对缓慢。另一种说法认为呢，我国反腐败工作，越反腐败案件越多，涉案的政府官员呢级别越来越高，金额越来越大。那么我想问总理，您对这两种说法有何评价？新一届政府将采取哪些措施推动我国政治体制改革进一步深化？对建立清正廉洁高效的政府，您有何设想？谢谢。</text>, <text>I’m from Xinhua News Agency. We have seen the following two kinds of opinions in overseas media. First, they believe that China has accomplished a lot in economic reform. By contrast, the pace of political restructuring seems quite slow. And the other view is that as the anti-corruption campaign gets more intensive in China, it only served to detect more corruption cases involving officials of even higher ranking accepting even bigger sum of bribery. What is your comment on these uh two reports? And what measures would the new government come up with to further deepen political restructuring and to build a clean, honest, diligent and efficient government? </text>, <text>推进政治体制的改革，是我们党和政府坚定不移的目标。</text>, <text>To advance political restructuring is a firm objective of our party and government.</text>, <text>我们的政治体制改革，始终围绕“什么是社会主义、怎样建设社会主义、如何完善社会主义”，建设一个什么样的党、怎样建设党这样两个重大问题来进行。</text>, <text>We have always approached the subject of political restructuring from two major perspectives. One is what is socialism, how to build and improve socialism, and the other is what kind of party to build and how to build it.</text>, <text>其基本目标是：发展社会主义民主，完善社会主义法制，依法治国。</text>, <text>The basic objective is as follows, we will develop socialist democracy, improve socialist legal system, and run the country in accordance with law.</text>, <text>最终实现人民当家作主。</text>, <text>Eventually ensure the people's role as masters of the country.</text>, <text>本届政府推进政治体制改革打算从三个方面入手：</text>, <text>This government plans to push forward political restructuring in three aspects.</text>, <text>第一，建立科学民主的决策机制，重大的经济决策、重大的经济问题和重大的经济项目要经过充分论证，形成领导、群众和专家相结合的决策机制。</text>, <text>First, scientific and democratic decision-making. Before we make any major decisions on big economic issues or economic projects, we would s-we would seek opinions and views from officials, experts and the general public for a thorough debate. In this way, we can have a democratic decision-making mechanism.</text>, <text>第二，依法行政。政府部门和公务人员都要按照宪法和法律执行公务，同时又要接受宪法和法律的约束和规范。</text>, <text>Second, law-based administration. Government departments and civil servants must perform their duties in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and law and act within the bounds of laws and regulations.</text>, <text>第三，民主监督。政府要自觉接受人民代表大会的监督，接受政协的民主监督，接受群众和舆论的监督。</text>, <text>Third, democratic supervision. The government will willingly subject themselves to su-to supervision by the people's congresses, the democratic supervision from the CPPCC and the supervision of the general public and the media.</text>, <text>只有让人民监督政府，政府才不敢懈怠。只有人人负起责任来，才不会人亡政息。</text>, <text>Only when the public are asked to supervise the government, the government cannot afford to slacken its efforts. And only every person assumes his or her responsibility, can we ensure the vigor and vitality of government.</text>, <text>尽管这些年啊，我们反腐败取得很大的成绩，但是应当承认，在我们社会还存在比较严重的腐败现象。随着经济经济的转轨，在某些领域尤为突出。</text>, <text>In the past few years we have accomplished a lot in our anti-corruption efforts, yet we still have to admit that at present corruption remains a quite serious problem. At the time of economic structural transition, this problem is especially serious in some areas.</text>, <text>我们政府新一届政府准备从四个方面加强反腐败斗争。</text>, <text>The new government is prepared to step up anti-corruption efforts in four aspects.</text>, <text>第一，严格公务员的纪律。</text>, <text>First, strictly enforce discipline of the civil service.</text>, <text>第二，严处公务员执法犯罪。</text>, <text>Second, get tough with law-breaking civil servants with more severe punishment.</text>, <text>第三，推进政府机构改革。改革管理制度，改革行政审批制度，改革资金管理制度，改革人事制度。</text>, <text>Third, we will press ahead with the institutional reform. We will reform the systems of administration, the system of administrative examination approval, the system of financial resources management and also the system of management of human resources.</text>, <text>第三，加强各方面对我们的监督。我在在这在这里，愿意代表我们新一届政府向大家表示，从我们自己做起，以身作则，接受全国人民的监督。</text>, <text>Finally, subject government to increased supervision from all sides.</text>, <text>Here, on behalf of the new government I would like to solemnly pledge that we will take the lead in setting a good example and we will willingly </text>, <text>accept public supervision by the people of the country.</text>, <text>下一个问题。第三排，日本经济新闻记者。第三排。</text>, <text>n/i</text>, <text>谢谢。呃你好，我是日本经济新闻的使者。呃--温总理我想问下呃首先那个呃金融方面的问题。那个四大商业银行处理不良资产的那个问题已经成为中国经济的比较大的课题。啊请问，呃--是不是有可能投入财政资金，呃怎样提高四大银行的竞争力？还有一个是总理，呃去年有您有计划访问日本，呃今年是《日中和平友好条约》25周年，您是不是打算年内访问日本？谢谢。</text>, <text>I’m from Nihon Keizai Shimbun: um On financial subjects, I want to ask, uh whether the government would this-inject public funds into the four state-run commercial banks to help them dispose of their non-performing loans and to make them more competitive? The second question is, this year marks the 25th anniversary of the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between China and Japan. Do you have any plan to visit Japan within this year?</text>, <text>为了降低金融不良资产，这些年我们做了很大的努力，包括剥离了14000亿元的不良资产，成立了四家金融管理公司\n",
      "<action>gaze interpreter</action>-资产管理公司加以处置。</text>, <text>We have been making vigorous efforts to reduce the amount of non-performing loans for the state-owned commercial banks. We set up four asset-management companies which have stripped 1.4 trillion RMB Yuan of bad loans from the commercial banks.</text>, <text>但是目前啊四家国有商业银行的不良资产率，如果按照四级分类法，还达到高达21.4%。如果按照国际通行的五级分类法，要达到25%左右。其中，损失资产占相当大的比例。</text>, <text>But as far as the amount of non-performing loans troubling the four state-owned commercial banks are concerned, if we use the four-category classification criterion, then the ratio of the non-performing loan stands at 21.4%. If we use the five-grade classification criteria, which is a common international practice, then the ratio is as high as about 25%. And losses actually are quite a considerable percentage of these non-performing loans.</text>, <text>改变国有商业银行的经营状况，需要有政策的扶持，包括补充资本金和剥离不良资产。过去五年，我们曾利用发行2700亿元特别国债补充了银行资本金。同时，剥离了14000亿元的不良资产。但是根本解决银行的问题是在改革。</text>, <text>To improve their operation, it is necessary to give them policy support to increase their equity and help them get rid of the non-performing assets. Over the past five years, through the issues of special treasury bonds, we increased their equity by 270 billion Yuan. <strategy_addition>And as I said earlier</strategy_addition>, we helped them get rid of 1.4 trillion Yuan of non-performing loans. However, the fundamental solution still lies in reform.</text>, <text>在于建立现代的公司治理结构和现代金融企业制度。</text>, <text>The key is to ensure corporate governance, and to set up modern financial corporate system.</text>, <text>并且创造条件实行股份制。</text>, <text>And the conditions must be created to turn them into sharing-holding banks.</text>, <text>至于说到中日关系问题，我想说几句话。</text>, <text>As for the China-Japan relationship, I wish to make the following comments.</text>, <text>中日啊是一衣带水的近邻邻邦，有2000多年的友好交往。但是在近代史也有过很大的曲折。</text>, <text>China and Japan are close neighbors separated by a strip of water and have had over 2,000 years of friendly exchanges, except that in modern times, the relationship suffered tremendous twists and turns.</text>, <text>如何正确对待和处理日本侵华的那段历史，始终是发展中日关系的政治基础。</text>, <text>A correct view and handling of Japan's past aggression against China has always served as the political basis of the growth of bilateral ties.</text>, <text>我们希望日本政府恪守中日建交的三个文件，以史为鉴，面向未来。</text>, <text>We hope the Japanese government will abide by the three documents on the normalization of relationship and use history as a mirror and look forward into the future.</text>, <text>我们希望发展同日本的各方面关系，包括高层往来。</text>, <text>We hope to develop relations with Japan in all areas, including in field of high-level visits.</text>, <text>至于我自己，啊我希望在一个适当的气氛到日本去访问。</text>, <text>As for myself</text>, <text>I hope my visit can take place under an appropriate atmosphere.</text>, <text>下一个-</text>, <text>n/i</text>, <text>谢谢。</text>, <text>Thank you.</text>, <text>下一个问题。后边，后边那位。</text>, <text>n/i</text>, <text>谢谢***。总理您好，我是台湾中天电视台的记者许舒婷。嗯想请教您，从今年年初以来啊，台湾方面在两岸关系上有些新的做法，比如提出希望建立两岸和平稳定的一个互动的架构，此外在两岸的这个“三通”以及直航上也有一些比较积极的做法，那么大家都很希望赶快看到两岸关系能够进入一个良性循环的互动。不过在此之前啊我们一直没有机会了解您对两岸关系的一些看法，能不能借今天这个机会请您跟我们谈一下您对台湾的了解跟认识是什么？而新一届政府成立之后，在对台-呃在两岸关系上有哪些主要的工作要推动？您个人的期待又是什么？谢谢。</text>, <text>I’m from uh Taiwan. Since the beginning of this year, the Taiwan side has come up with new suggestions and measures to improve the relations across the Taiwan straits. For instance, they have put forward the idea of setting up a mechanism to ensure peace and stability in the cross-strait relationship. They have also done something positive towards the three direct links including the direct shipping and air services. So we would like to know what is your view on how we can bring about the sound interaction between the two sides of the Taiwan straits. In the past, we have not heard much directly from you on your perspective on the question of Taiwan. So we would like to know what is your perspective and what is your knowledge about Taiwan?

Mainland I see none, tears of sorrow cascade. Bury me on the highest mountaintop so I can get a glimpse of my hometown. Hometown I see none, but lives forever in my mind. The lofty sky is deeply blue, the vast wildness not seen through. Oh, boundless universe, would you hear me and this elegy of the nation. What a touching poem he has written, which strikes-strikes  cord on the sentiment of all the Chinese people.</text>, <text>中国政府啊将坚定不移地执行和平统一、一国两制方针。在一个中国前-在一个中国基础上，尽早恢复两岸的对话与谈判，反对“台独”。</text>, <text>The Chinese government will continue to unswervingly pursue the policy of peaceful reunification on the basis of “One Country, Two Systems”.

I know so well the stability and development of this country have not come by easily.</text>, <text>80年代末90年代初，世界风云变幻，苏联巨变-苏联解体，东欧巨变，在中国也发生了一场政治风波。党和政府紧紧依靠人民，采取果断措施，稳定了国内局势。并且继续推进改革开放，走有中国特色社会主义道路。13年来，中国所取得的巨大成就说明，稳定是至关重要的。</text>, <text>The end of the 1980s and beginning of the 1990s saw highly volatile international situation. The Soviet Union disintegrated, Eastern Europe changed drastically, and political turbulences also occurred in China. The Party and government relied firmly on the people, took resolute measures and stabilized the domestic situation.

The tremendous achievements we have scored over the past thirteen years have fully proven that stability is of vital importance.</text>, <text>关于伊拉克问题，中国的立场一贯性啊。</text>, <text>On- </text>, <text>这个中国的立场是一贯的-</text>, <text>On the question of- </text>, <text>负责任的。</text>, <text>Sorry. On the question of Iraq, China’s position has been consistent, and we adopt a responsible position.</text>, <text>我们主张伊拉克的问题应该在联合国的框架内，通过政治手段和平加以解决，</text>, <text>China stands for a peaceful settlement of the Iraqi issue within the UN framework through political means.</text>, <text>尽量避免战争。</text>, <text>Every effort should be made to avoid war.</text>, <text>联合国1441号决议应该得到全面切实的贯彻。</text>, <text>UN Resolution 1441 must be comprehensively and effectively implemented.</text>, <text>核查工作应该继续推进。</text>, <text>Inspection work should continue.</text>, <text>同时，我们也主张伊拉克政府应该严格地、切实地遵守联合国的有关决议。</text>, <text>At the same time, China holds the view that the Iraqi government should strictly and effectively abide by the relevant UN Resolutions.</text>, <text>主动的配合国际组织啊搞好武器的核查工作，彻底销毁大规模杀伤性武器。</text>, <text>We believe the Iraqi side</text>, <text>should be active in cooperating with the UN agencies to make the work of inspection a success and to destroy all weapons of mass destruction.</text>, <text>现在伊拉克的局势啊已经箭在弦上，一触即发。但是只要有一点希望，我们仍旧不放弃通过政治和平解决的努力。</text>, <text>Now with regard to the situation in Iraq, the arrow has already been placed on the bow. It is a touch-and-go situation. However, so long as there is still one gleam of hope, we will not give up our efforts for a peaceful and political settlement.</text>, <text>下一个问题。</text>, <text>n/i</text>, <text>总理您好，我是中央人民广播电台的记者。农村税费改革今年将在全国全面推开。您曾经说过，我们一定会走出历史上所谓“黄宗曦-黄宗曦定律”这个怪圈。请问您认为我们的税费改革怎么才能走出这个怪圈？谢谢。</text>, <text>I’m from China National Radio: The rural tax-for-fee reform will be extended across country this year. You once said that China would definitely be able to break the vicious cycle of the Law of Huang Zongxi, which means, in history, tax reform that aimed to reducing farmer’s burden always ended up with exacerbating their burden, So my question is how can the current tax-for-fee reform break such a vicious cycle?</text>, <text>这个问题我讲的已经很多了。我想强调两点。第一，农村税费改革的实质，是要改革农村不适宜生产力发展的上层建筑的某些环节，最重要的是要精简人员。</text>, <text>I’ve already talked a lot about this subject, so here I only want to make two points. First, the essence of this reform is to reform the certain links in the rural superstructure that do not serve the development of productive forces. The most important work is to downsize the institutions.</text>, <text>中国<strategy_omission>古代</strategy_omission>《大学》有四句话叫生财有道，生之者众，食之者寡，为之者疾，用之者抒。现在在农村倒过来了，“生之者寡，食之者众”。一个县十二三万人口，吃财政饭的多达5700万人-5700-5700人。啊。如果不精简机构，不减少人员，农民的负担不能得到彻底减轻。</text>, <text>In the Book of Learning in China<strategy_omission> </strategy_omission>, it talks about the way to accumulate wealth. There are many people who produce, there are very few people who consume, and people work very hard to produce more financial wealth and people practice economy when they spend. In this way, wealth is accumulated. However, the situation today in the countryside is just the opposite. There are very few who produce whereas there are a lot who consume. And people do not work very hard to create more financial resources</text>, <text>, but on contrary, they squander and want to spend as much as they wish. For instance, in a county with a population of only 120 to 130, 000 people, </text>, <text>5,700 people live on taxpayers’ money by being on the government’s payroll. So I think to find a fundamental way to reduce the burden of farmers, we need to cut down the size of institutional functionries </text>, <text>and to shed the people who are not necessary.</text>, <text>与此同时，要加大财政对农村的支持力度。我们的最终目标是要把一切不应该向农民收取的税费，全部减下来，但这需要一个过程。</text>, <text>At the same time, we must increase financial support to the countryside. Our objective is that we want to ensure that the farmers are not asked to pay taxes that they are not entitled to pay. But I know this might take some time.</text>, <text>从今年开始，我们就出台了一项措施，就是新增对科技、教育、文化、卫生的财政支出，主要用于农村。</text>, <text>This year, we have adopted a new policy. For the additional financial resources earmarked for the undertakings in the fields of science, technology, education, culture, and health care will mainly find their way to the countryside.</text>, <text>谢谢。</text>, <text>Thank you.</text>, <text>下一位。第三排中东社，Middle East Agency.</text>, <text>n/i</text>, <text>I’m Haidee Lee, Middle East News Agency: eh Mr. Premier, you-as you assume your office, it is a very dangerous situation, in the Middle East especially and all the world as a whole. So I think you maybe need our more our praise more than our congratulations. Eh Anyhow, I want to ask you for your comment on this ultimatum that US president yesterday issued to the Iraqi president? Do you agree with me that this is a very flagrant um violation to new order and to er international laws and er this sovereignty of the states?

Thank you.</text>, <text>温总理，我是中东社的记者。目前世界形势并不太平，比如说在中东地区就是一个非常危险的地区，所以我们很想了解您关于这些问题的看法。您是否同意今天美国总统对伊拉克总统所发出的最后通牒？他讲到呢，伊拉克是公然地违反了国际法的一些规定。您能否就此最后通牒发表一些看法？另外能否介绍一下中国对于中东这些热点地区的问题的看法？</text>, <text>中东地区始终是中国和世界人民关注的焦点。</text>, <text>Middle East has always been the focus of attention of not only the Chinese people, but of people of all other countries.</text>, <text>当前突出的是伊拉克问题和巴以问题。</text>, <text>Of course what is headline news now is the situation in Iraq and the problems between Palestine and Israel.</text>, <text>我注意到，布什总统在北京时间上午9点发表的演说。</text>, <text>I have taken note of the address by President Bush, which he delivered, according to Beijing time, at 9:00 this morning.</text>, <text>中国的立场是鲜明的，</text>, <text>China’s position is a clear-cut one.</text>, <text>我们将继续坚持通过政治手段和平解决伊拉克的问题。</text>, <text>We insist on continuing efforts to seek a peaceful solution to the question of Iraq through political means.</text>, <text>我们认为，1441号决议是符合联合国宪章原则的，各国应该遵守。</text>, <text>In our view, UN Resolution 1441 is consistent with the UN-with the principles of the UN Charter. Therefore, all countries should adhere to this Resolution.</text>, <text>我们对于巴以冲突一直深感忧虑和关心，</text>, <text>We have always been deeply worried and concerned about the conflict between Palestine and Israel.</text>, <text>我们衷心希望以巴双方能够配合国际各方面的协调，按照联合国的有关决议和“土地换和平”的原则，通过政治谈判和平解决巴以冲突。</text>, <text>We sincerely hope that their conflicts can be resolved peacefully through political dialogue between the two sides. We hope the two sides can co-coordinate their efforts with the coordination efforts from various sides in the international community and comply with the relevant UN Resolutions including the principle of Land for Peace.</text>, <text>我们不希望中东燃起战火，一个和平稳定的中东有利于全世界。</text>, <text>The flame of war is the last thing we wish to see in the Middle East. A peaceful and stable Middle East will serve the world well.</text>, <text>下一个问题。第二排《金融时报》。</text>, <text>n/i</text>, <text>你好总理，我是《金融时报》的记者。啊我想补充一下金融方面的问题。啊嗯你们现在是否有计划允许啊私营银行的成立？呃什么时候要完全放开呃银行利率的波动范围？嗯第三个是嗯那个四-国有四大银行你们什么时候要让他们把他们的很大一部分不良资产转让给那个四家呃管理公司？谢谢。</text>, <text>I’m from Financial Times: I want to raise some follow-up questions on the financial subjects. Do you have any plan to allow the establishment of private banks? When are you going to fully liberalize the exchange rate regime? And when would let the uh state-owned commercial banks transfer the large percentage of their non-performing loans to the four assets management companies?</text>, <text>金-金融时报，英国来的金融时报。</text>, <text>n/i</text>, <text>你的问题使我想起2000年访问英国中央银行。</text>, <text>Um Your question reminds me of my visit to Bank of England in the year 2000, the Central Bank of the United Kingdom.</text>, <text>我发现英国的中央银行的大门很小，啊，窗户很小。大门很多，窗户很小。</text>, <text>Uh I discovered that in the Central Bank of the UK, the Central Bank building has many uh </text>, <text>gates or doors, </text>, <text>but very small windows.</text>, <text>我了解到英国几百年的历史。</text>, <text>Through the visit, I have more knowledge about the history of the development of the uh financial sector in the United Kingdom over hundreds of years.</text>, <text>而中国提出要把银行办成真正的银行，不是财政的出纳，才只有十几年的历史。</text>, <text>In comparison, China only has a history of more than 10 years um from the day when banks were regarded as cashier of the government to the objective of turning the banks into financial institutions in the real sense.</text>, <text>我们已经有了以民间为主的股份制银行，比如民生银行。</text>, <text>Actually, China has already had the shareholding banks, which mainly financed by the funds from the social sectors, for instance, Minseng Bank.</text>, <text>随着监管的加强，中国的金融市场的所有制形式势必会多样化，但这是一个比较长的过程。</text>, <text>As we improve our regulatory capabilities, inevitably, there will be many different forms of ownership in the financial institutions in China, but of course this will take quite uh some time before that happens.</text>, <text>谢谢你。</text>, <text>Thank you.</text>, <text>另外一个问题。最后一个问题。</text>, <text>The last question.</text>, <text>谢谢新闻官。总理你好，我是香港凤凰卫视的记者。熟悉您的人都说你是一个重视事实，也非常注重数据的人。那么麻烦您告诉我们，在目前中国国情当中，有哪些数据您认为是最为可喜的？有哪些数据认为最忧心、牵挂和关注？它们代表了什么样的意义？另外，5年后的中国您期望是什么样的中国？谢谢。</text>, <text>I’m from uh Phoenix TV, Hong Kong: According to people who know you well, you believe in facts and you let statistics speak for themselves. Could you tell me what are the figures about China’s present situation that satisfy you most and that um worry you most? What is their significance? Could you tell us what China you would expect five years from now？</text>, <text>中国驻-瑞士驻中国的大使啊-前任大使曾经说我的脑子像comput。</text>, <text>Um Former Swiss Ambassador to China once said that my brain works like a computer.</text>, <text>我确实装了许多数字。</text>, <text>Indeed many statistics are stored in my brain.</text>, <text>这些数字有使我高兴的，也有-也有使我忧虑的。</text>, <text>Some make me happy. Some make me worry.</text>, <text>譬如说中国改革开放以来，GDP的增长平均在9%以上。中国近5年，尽管 出现亚洲金融风波，GDP的增长平均在7.7%，去年达到8%。中国的外汇储备达到3000亿等等，这些是使我高兴的。</text>, <text>The following figures are very encouraging to me and make me happy. For instance, since the beginning of reform and opening up, China has averaged an annual increase of its GDP by over 9%. In recent five years, the financial crisis in Asia notwithstanding, our GDP still match a goal on an average basis by 7.7% annually, and last year the GDP grow at a rate of 8%. I am also very happy about the figure um relating to the size of our foreign exchange reserve, which now stands at <strategy_addition>US$</strategy_addition> 300 billion.</text>, <text>但是有些数字恐怕连记者也不完全清楚，啊连记者也不完全清楚比如中国的劳动力有7亿4千万。而欧美整个发达国家的劳动力只有4亿3千万。</text>, <text>En There are some figures maybe the correspondents do not know so well. For instance, China has a workforce of China has a workforce of 740 million people, but for the uh developed economies, European countries and US combined, their workforce stands at 430 million.</text>, <text>中国每年新增劳动力1000万，中国的下岗和失业人口大约1400万。</text>, <text>Every year we will have additional ten million new entrance into the workforce, and the number of laid-off and unemployed workers stands at about 14 million.</text>, <text>进城的农民工啊一般保持在1亿2千万。</text>, <text>The size of migrant workers who seek job opportunities in the cities, uh normally is kept around 120 million.</text>, <text>中国面临巨大的就业压力。中国13亿人口有9亿农民，说是目前没有摆脱贫困的是3000万左右。但是大家知道，这是低水平的，人均625块。</text>, <text>China is under tremendous pressure for employments. Our population is 1.3 billion, of which 900 million are farmers in the countryside, more than 30 million farmers are still living under the poverty line, even for those who have been lifted above the poverty line uh their life is at a low level the per capita income for them is only 625 yuan.</text>, <text>如果标准再增加200块，中国的贫困人口就是9000万。</text>, <text>If we set the benchmark of the poverty line at uh with an increase of 200 yuan, then the uh total poor population would be 90 million.</text>, <text>中国东西差距很大，大家恐怕只是从概念上有，我想说一个数字，中国沿海五六个省市GDP的总值超过50%。</text>, <text>The gap between China’s east and China’s west is really very wide. Maybe I can offer you some figure to help you understand this concept even better. The GDP from five to six provinces in the coastal area accounts for more than half of China’s total GDP.</text>, <text>我这几个数字已经点出了三个问题：农村问题、下岗和再就业问题、这个解决贫困人口的生活问题，东西差距问题。</text>, <text>En. A number of problems have been reflected by these figures, we need to solve the problems in the countryside and problems facing farmers, we need to solve problems for the uh laid-off and unemployed workers by creating more job opportunities we should also address the problems of in poverty, as well as the gap between the east and west.</text>, <text>因此，当好中国的总理不容易。</text>, <text>Therefore, it’s not an easy job at all to be a good premier.</text>, <text>如果说我现在的心情，我觉得我身上的担子有千钧重。</text>, <text>If you ask about my feeling now, I feel that the responsibility on my shoulder is extremely great.</text>, <text>我希望-我非常希望跟大家交流意见，因此，破例再给一个提问的机会。</text>, <text>I-</text>, <text>I very much enjoy this opportunity to share views with the press, so I would ask one more correspondent to ask a question.</text>, <text>好下一个问题。CNN记者。</text>, <text>n/i</text>, <text>Premier Wen, uh I’m *** with CNN. you spoke of experience in the war in your childhood. I suppose you also went through the Cultural Revolution when you were in your 20s. How did these experiences influence the way you view China’s domestic and foreign affairs, problems, specifically on Iraq? Are you-Does that does that-make you an anti-war activist? Do you approve or oppose the looming war in Iraq? Thank you. </text>, <text>我是CNN的记者。刚才您讲到您孩提时代是在战乱当中度过的。</text>, <text>慢点慢点。</text>, <text>啊，我是CNN的记者。在开场白中您谈到，您孩提时代是在战乱当中度过的。在您二十几岁的时候，您也经历了“文化大革命”，您能否谈一下“文化大革命”的这段经历对于您对中国国内的问题、国际问题一些看法是否产生什么样的影响？特别是关于伊拉克这个问题，您的这段孩提时代的战争的这种经历是否使您成为一个反战的积极分子。对于一触即发的伊拉克战争，您是支持还是反对？</text>, <text>中国-新中国成立啊已经半个多世纪，走过辉煌的道路，也出现过严重的曲折。“文化大革命”就是个曲折。</text>, <text>More than 50 years have passed since People's Republic of China was founded in 1949. We had our glorious success. We also suffered setbacks. And the Cultural Revolution was one such major setback.</text>, <text>但是我始终相信，社会主义是大海，大海是不会枯竭的，大海可以容纳百川。只有吸收人类一切文明成果，社会主义才能巩固和完善。这个时间要很长，需要上百年，甚至几百年的时间。</text>, <text>But I have always firmly believed that socialism is like a big ocean.
