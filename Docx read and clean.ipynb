      "(0) Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. Today we are ha-very happy to have the new premier of the State Council and the new vice premiers to meet the press. First some opening remarks from the Premier and then he will take your questions. \n",
      "\n",
      "(1) Ladies and gentlemen, friends of the press. First I would like to thank you for your hard work in covering the NPC and CPPCC sessions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) Let me present to you the vice-premiers who are with us this morning. Vice-premier Zhang Gaoli, \n",
      "(1) Vice-premier Liu Yandong, \n",
      "Vice-premier Wang Yang \n",
      "and Vice-premier Ma Kai.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) We sincerely thank the NPC’s deputies for their trust. From the moment we take on the new role, I have deeply felt the heavy responsibilities the Chinese people of all nationalities have placed on our shoulders. We will be true to the Constitution, loyal to the people and the people’s wish will point the direction of government’s efforts, we will take as our secret mission the peoples’ aspirations for a better life. We will revere laws, respect the people, take on our responsibilities and have the courage to get things done, so as to benefit the whole nation and build a strong and prosperous country. These are my opening remarks. Now the floor is open for questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) Lianhezaobao from Singapore. The plan for reforming state council institutions has attracted a lot of attention. Mr premier, is it your ideal plan and how do you intend to achieve the goals of streamlining government and transforming its functions? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) You asked whether this is our ideal plan, I think, to succeed in doing anything, one has to strike a proper balance between ideal and reality. The core of the reform plan is to transform government functions. Of course, it is also about streamlining government and delegate powers to lower levels, the institutional reforms is about optimizing the distribution of power within the government and transforming government functions is about redefining and rationalizing the relationship between the government on the one hand and the market and society on the other. Put simply, we need to leave to the market and society what they can do well, and on the part of the government, we need to manage well those matters that for within our preview.\n",
      "(3) Institutional reform is not easy, transforming government functions will be even more difficult, because it would require more in-depth changes. When I visited local communities, I often heard people complain to me that they would need the approve of several dozens of departments to get something done or start their business, and people are quite frustrated about this. Such as date of affairs is not good for government efficiency, it might create opportunities for corruption or rent-seeking behavior, and it would harm the image of the government. Therefore, we will start with reform of the system, of government examination and approval. Right now there are over 1,700 items that still require the approval of state council departments. Within the term of this department, we are determined to cut that figure by at least one third.\n",
      "(2) As for the view that expressed by some people that the government has some misplaced roles, then let’s restore to the market and the hand has misgrown on the government. The reform is about curbing government power. It’s a self-imposed revolution, it would require real sacrifice and this would be painful, but this is demanded by development and wanted by the people. Then we are determined to make that sacrifice. We will keep our promise and match up our words with action. We will never secretly hold on to the powers or shy away from real difficult issues. We will never play any games to get around the requirements of reform. Thank you. \n",
      "(1) I’m with People’s Daily and its website. Many people believe that your government will face a daunting agenda. Mr Premier, what are the goals of your government? And what are the top priorities on your agenda?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "(3) You’ve asked a big question. As for the goals of my government, the Eighteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China set up that in comprehensive detail, those will be the goals of my government. The nearer we are to our goal of modernization, the more risks and the more challenges we might encounter. China is such a large country, there are naturally, so many things for us to handle. But to summarize, the highest priority will be to maintain sustainable economic growth, it can be expected that the economic environment facing China will continue to be serious and complex. We must be prepared for potential adversity and handle the changing situation in a calm fashion. We need to maintain steady economic growth, prevent inflation and control latent risks, so-so that there won’t be big fluctuations in our economic performance. To realize the goal we have set for our country by 2020, we would have to register an annual GDP growth rate of around seven point five percent, that would not be easy. But we have favorable conditions in place and enormous potential in domestic demand. The key is to have economic transformation. We need to combine the dividends of reform, the potential of domestic demand, and creativity and vitality of creativity, so that this will together form new drivers of economic growth. We need to enhance the quality and efficiency of economic growth, raise employment figures and people’s income, and enhance environmental protection and saving of resources, so that we will fully upgrade the Chinese economy.\n",
      "(2) Secondly, we need to work constantly to improve the people’s lives. That is to say, we need to raise the income of urban and rural populations, especially the low income group, and we need to expand the size of middle income group. Now the government is about improving the people’s lives, we need provide for the basic necessities of our people, we need to create a social safety net that covers the entire population and protect the people’s basic needs, that would involve compulsory education, medical care, old age insurance, housing and so on. We need to work hard to gradually strengthen the weak links in our country’s development. Also we need to improve the subsistence allowance system and a system for patients suffering from major diseases, so that the really poor people can have something to fall back on. If these people experience even more difficulties in their life, that might disrupt the moral and psychological baseline of our society. To do that, the government will make its utmost efforts, we will mobilize the forces in our society so as to protect the people’s subsistence rights and their dignity.\n",
      "(1) Third, we will promote social fairness. Fairness is a source of societal creativity and the yardstick for improving the people’s satisfaction with the work of the government. The government should be the guardian of social fairness. We need to work hard to create equal opportunities for everyone, for people from urban and rural areas, and for all those people regardless of their family background, so that people’s hard work will be duly rewarded. And whatever type of wealth creator you are, a state-owned enterprise, a private enterprise or individually-run business, as long as you compete on a level playing field and conduct your business in a clean and honest way, then you will be able to taste success.\n",
      "\n",
      "(3) To meet these three goals and to fulfil these three tasks, the following three things are essential. First, we need to build an innovative government so that we can further unleash the vitality of economy and society through reform and opening-up. Second, we need to build a clean government and make our government more credible, effective and efficient. Third, we need to build a government <strategy_revision>under the rule of law</strategy_revision>, laws should have a sacred place in our society. No matter who you are, no matter what you intend to do, you must not exceed the boundaries of the law. Under the guidance of the rule of law, we intend to build a modern economy, a modern society and a modern government.\n",
      "(2) To achieve these three tasks, we would have to make arduous efforts. The good thing is my predecessor Premier Wen Jiabao and my colleagues who have <strategy_revision>retired </strategy_revision>have laid a good foundation for our future work. We would like to convey our deepest respect for them. I am convinced that under the leadership of CPC central committee with comrade Xi Jinping as the general secretary, and with the hard efforts and wisdom of 1.3 billion Chinese people, we will achieve success and achieve the goals of national renewal and modernization. Thank you.\n",

      "(0) China national radio and its website. In recent period, some cases of corruption have been exposed in different parts of the country. Mr Premier, what specific measures will your government adopt to increase the people’s confidence in anti-corruption efforts?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) Let me add that I want to thank the People’s Daily and its website for raising the last question. And you have raised an important question. Corruption is at complete variance with the nature of our government, the Chinese government has the unshakeable resolve and determination to fight corruption. And here, let me make my position clear.\n",
      "(2) Clean government should start with oneself. Only one is upright him or herself can he or her ask others to be upright. This is an ancient atige [sound] but also a truth. Since ancient times, holding government office and making money have been two separate lanes. Since we have chosen public service, we should give up all thought of making money. And we will readily accept the supervision of the whole society and the media.\n",
      "(2) We will also establish a sound mechanism so that officials are unable to or dare not to practice corruption, so that we can punish corrupt officials to the full extent of the law. Even more important, is to make sure that power will be exercised in an open and transparent fashion so that the people can supervise the government more fully and more effectively, so that we can insulate the power against possibilities of abuse.\n",
      "(2) And we need to win the trust of the people and bring benefits to them by practicing frugality in government affairs. If the people are to lead good lives then the government must be put on a tight budget. Recently, I have received report that central government fiscal revenues only increased by 1.6 percent in January and February of this year. In the future, you might not see high speed growth of fiscal revenues in China. However, spending on items related to people’s lives is a must. It will only increase, not decrease. That means we would have to cut spending on government operations. Here, let me lay down three clear rules: Within the term of my government, First, we will not use government coffers to construct any new offices, house or guesthouses for the government. Second, the number of people on the government’s payroll will decrease, not increase. Third, spending on official hospitality, overseas trips for official business and the use-the purchase of official vehicles will decrease, not increase. The central government will lead by example and all lower levels of the government must follow suit. Thank you.\n",
      "Premier Li, China has called for building a new type of relationship with the US, what would the Chinese side like the US to do including with the so-called China’s privilege to Asia, will China stop the cyber attacking against the US since it has now become an issue of American national security.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "(0) You should earn double income since you acted as your own interpreter. \n",
      "(0) Your question reminds me of a US media report that I have read recently. The US side recently made the point conflict between major countries is not a law of physics. I subscribe to that view. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) Your question also reminds me of a  visit I made to the United States in the 1980s, at that time, the US was in election season and I met with people from both the two main political parties. Both sides assured me that no matter who might come into power, cooperation with China and commitment to the “One China” policy will not change. Over the last decades, the China US relationship, despite some ups and downs, has generally moved forward. Why? Because the development of our relations meets the fundamental interests of people in both countries and serves the global trend of peace and development.\n",
      "(1) Like in the past, the new government in China will attach great importance to our relationship with the United States, the relationship between the world’s largest developing country and the world’s largest developed country, our government will work with the Obama Administration to work together to build a new type of major country relationship.\n",
      "(2) Now you also asked about how we can build that kind of new relationship between China and the United States. Since I began to work in the central government, I’ve often met with US political leaders. They’ve been very candid with me. They said that they came to advance US interests. And I said to them, I work for China’s interests. So that gives us something in common and our interests have convergence. Over thirty years ago, trade between China and the United States only stood at 1 billion US dollars. Last year, our two-way trade approached 500 billion US dollars. Going forward, we will continue to pursue mutual benefit and the trade and investment opportunities, and space for pursuing such cooperation will only be bigger than the last thirty-plus years, and this would deliver tangible benefits to people in both countries.\n",
      "(1) Admittedly, there are some differences between China and the United States, but as long as we respect each other’s major concerns and manage our differences, then our common interests will far outweigh the differences that we might have. China and the United States have our own distinctive civilizations and cultures. We can learn from each other. And we need to deepen our friendship between the people of our two countries so as to build stronger social foundation for good bilateral relations.\n",
      "(0) The Asia Pacific region is one in which the interests of China and the US intersect the most. Both countries have stated that we want to uphold regional stability and promote regional prosperity. We hope that these commitments will be reflected in action. China and the United States should sound interactions in the Asia Pacific region. And starting from this, we will move to build a new type of relationship between major countries. That will also be good for peace and development in the Asia pacific region and the world at large.\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) You also asked about hacker attacks. This is a worldwide problem. And in fact, China itself is a main target of such attacks. China does not support, indeed, we opposed to such activities. In your question, I sensed the presumption of guilt, I think we should not make groundless accusations against each other and spend more time doing practical things that will contribute to cyber security. \n",
      "(0) THANK YOU.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "(0) China Central Television and CNTV, Mr Premier, you have often talked about the fact that reform will pay the biggest dividend. Recently, there has been many discussion on the website hosted by CCTV and some other media organizations about people’s questions for the Premier. There is a view in our society that reforming China has to navigate uncharted waters and advancing reform will be difficult because we would have to encounter vested interests, and these interests might stand in the way of further reform. Mr Premier, how do you intend to unleash the dividends of reform and how do you intend to push forward your reform agenda?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "(0) I’ve often said that reform pays the biggest dividend for China, it is because there is still room for improvement in our socialist market economy, there is great space for further unleashing productivity through reform, and there is great potential for making sure that the benefits of reform will reach the entire population. In advancing reform, the important thing is to take action. Talking the talk is not as good as walking the walk. We need to pursue market-oriented reforms, you asked what are the key reforms that we will drive, I’ve outlined three priorities of my government, in light of this, we will choose areas for reform that will make an immediate and systemic impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) We will pursue economic transformation. We will make full use of fiscal, financing, pricing and other policy instruments, and we will pursue reform of the budgetary system, to make it more open, transparent, standardized and inclusive. We will improve the people’s uh effectiveness in supervising government expenditure and revenues, improve the structure of government expenditure and revenue, and tilt government’s spending in favor of areas that will have a direct benefit for the people’s lives. In the financial sector, we will pursue market-oriented reform of the interest rate and the exchange rate, we will develop a multi-tiered capital market and raise the share of direct financing. We will also protect the lawful rights and interests of investors, especially small and medium investors. We will also drive economic transformation through opening-up. The important thing is to further open up the services sector, of course, looking ahead, our trade, especially trading goods, will continue to grow and even at a high speed in the years ahead. That will create enormous opportunities for the world, and help Chinese enterprises to upgrade themselves in the course of fair competition.\n",
      "(2) We will improve people’s well-being, and to do that, we need to reform the income distribution system. We need to confront the two biggest gaps in Chinese society, the gap between urban and rural areas and the gap between different regions. In particular, we need to confront the former gap as it involves over eight hundred million rural residents and over five hundred million urban residents. We need to take action to gradually narrow this gap. We also need to enhance reform of the social security system. We need to raise the level at which the social security funds are managed, and in the area of medical and old age insurance, we should gradually make sure that people can reimburse their expenses, and transfer their accounts to the places that they currently reside, this will also contribute to labor mobility in China.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) We also need to pursue reform to promote social fairness. We will review and eliminate those regulations that impede social fairness, so that transparent rules will trump hidden rules. At the same time, we will allow private capital to more smoothly and effectively enter financing, energy railway and other sectors. We will pursue reform in the social sector so as to promote upward social mobility. In some universities in China, the share of rural students is quite low, we need to gradually raise that, so as to give hardworking rural students hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) In pursuing reform, we need to focus on the key areas and ensure overall coordination. We want to pursue comprehensive reform covering all sectors, so as to make us clearer to the goal of socialism with Chinese characteristics.\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) You said that in pursuing reform, we now have to navigate uncharted waters, we may also have to confront some protracted problem, this is because we will have to shake up vested interests, sometimes, stirring vested interests may be more difficult than stirring the soul. But, however deep the water may be, we will wade into the water, this is because we have no alternative. Reform concerns the destiny of our country and the future of our nation, in pursuing reform, we need to have courage, wisdom and tenacity, but we can get these from the people and make solid progress in reform. Thank you. \n",
      "(0) United Daily News of Taiwan, in recent years, there has been major strides in cross straits relations. Mr Premier, what are your plans and vision for further promoting the peaceful development of cross straits relations in the time ahead? And under the new situation, will there be any new opportunities and new challenges confronting cross straits relations?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) The two sides of Taiwan Straits belong to the one and same China, the residents on the two sides of the Straits are fellow compatriots, the concept of compatriot is a deep-rooted one in the Chinese culture and I believe this is a reason that our nation has thrived uninterruptedly for five thousand years. Bones may be broken but not sinews because we are fellow compatriot. Between us, there no “knot” that cannot be untied.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) We are happy to see that in recent years, cross straits relations have enjoyed peaceful development and cross straits cooperation has yielded good fruits. I think, as long as we maintain “the one China” principle and the bond of compatriots between the two sides, then there will be great space and potential for advancing cross straits relations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "(3) We should make full use of the current opportunities facing us and work to expand these opportunities going forward. My government will fulfil the commitments made by the last government, and at the same time, work hard to identify new pillars of cross straits cooperation. In the course of opening-up and development on the mainland, we’ll give more consideration to the well-being and interests of our Taiwan compatriots, so that the two sides can share ring the fruits of our country’s development.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) And in the course of their development, Taiwan and Taiwan compatriots should make better use of the development opportunities presented by the mainland. Both the mainland and Taiwan belong to our common homeland, we need to maintain and develop well this common homeland, so that it will be full of flowers. When the flowers are in full bloom, there will be the time for the moon to be full again. Taking this opportunity, I would like you to convey my sincere greetings and best regards to our compatriots in Taiwan.\n",
      "(1) Xinhua News Agency. currently, there is much talk about urbanization and some people have expressed different views. Some believe that urbanization is a logical product of urban-of modernization, and therefore, the government needn’t push this deliberately. And many people are concerned that this process will deprave many rural residents of their land and create a new class –the urban poor. Mr Premier, what is your view on this?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) Another big question but I will try to answer it succinctly. I’m aware of most of the talk about globali-about urbanization and I take them seriously. The scale of urbanization in China is unprecedented in human history. Urbanization is important to China’s development and it will affect the world. There is some talk about urbanization and some concerns expressed about it. I think, people generally want us to make steady progress in urbanization.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "(4) Urbanization is a logical product of modernization and a general aspiration of rural residents in China, urbanization will unleash enormous consumption and investment demand and create many job opportunities, more directly, it will help to enrich farmers and benefit the whole nation. When I visited rural communities, people often talked to me about their aspiration for life in the future, and the folks put it in very simple language. They say, we hope to lead the same kind of life as our urban counterparts. In the past, this was just a dream, but urbanization has opened the door for the dream to come true. Some rural residents may wish to migrate to the cities to engage in secondary or tertiary industries, others might want to stay in their villages and engage in farming operations of appropriate scale. Either way, they can make more money and become richer. Every year, over ten million rural residents are migrating to the cities. This is an inevitable trend.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) We stress that we want to pursue a new type of urbanization. The strategy will be put people at the heart of it. Right now there are over 260 million migrant workers in cities. For those of them that want to integrate into urban life, we will gradually make it possible for them to do so, but this will be a long term and complex process that requires the support of job creation and provision of services. Urbanization is not about building big sprawling cities. We need to ensure proper balance between large, medium and small cities, and the eastern, central and western regions of China should pursue organization in light of their local conditions. It’s also very important to prevent the typical malaise that might plague big cities, so that we won’t have a situation where skyscrapers coexist with shanty towns. Within the term of this government, we are determined to redevelop over ten million different types of shanty dwellings so as to overcome the bifurcation within cities and to lower the threshold of urbanization. It’s also very important for the new type of urbanization to go hand in hand with agricultural modernization. Therefore, we need to keep the size of farmland above the red line of 100 million hectares, ensure food security and protect farmers’ interests.\n",
      "\n",
      "(3) Urbanization is a complex and big project. This will trigger profound changes in our economy and society and it needs to be supported by integrated reforms in many different areas. We need to overcome the various problems that might crop up in the course of urbanization. I know that according to the statistics currently available, there are about 500 suggestions and proposals about urbanization made during the NPC and CPPCC sessions. We will review all of them very carefully and pursue urbanization in a steady, active and prudent way.\n",

      "(1) 我是法国《费加罗报》的记者，现在环境污染和食品安全，包括北京的空气质量状况，已经成为严重的问题。我想请问，在中国政府保持经济增长的同时，能否同时解决这些问题？并且中国的公众和舆论是否可以更多地监督政府在这方面的措施？\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " (2) I said earlier that we want to fully upgrade the Chinese economy, that also includes that in the course of development, we will do our best to make sure that our people can breathe clean air and have safe drinking water and food. You talked about the weather in Beijing, in the recent period, not just Beijing, but extensive parts of eastern China have experienced some hazy weather, and like everyone of you, I was quite upset about that. This is a problem that has been built up over a long period of time. This government will show even greater resolve and take more vigorous efforts to clean up such pollution. As for the key regions and the man-made factors that we have identified, we will set deadlines for these to be addressed. As for water and soil pollution, we will need to develop a clear understanding of the extent of the problem and take resolute steps to improve the situation. Food safety is a matter of utmost importance because it has a direct bearing on the people’s quality of life and health. The government will take strong measures to punish the heartless producers with substandard and fake food, so that they will pay a high price.\n",
      "\n",
      "(4) I’m also concerned whether we can make rapid progress towards shifting the inefficient model of growth. I’ve said it’s no good to be poor in a beautiful environment but nor is it any good to be well-off but live with the consequences of environmental degradation. We need to develop a new thinking on development and pursue development in a scientific way. First, we shouldn’t incur any new problems and we need to raise environmental threshold. Second, we need to speed up efforts to overcome long-standing problems which include phasing out backward production facilities, we will face the situation and punish the offenders without mercy, and enforce the law with an iron fist.\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) We shouldn’t pursue economic growth at the expenses of the environment, such growth won’t satisfy the people, it is very important that the extent of pollution, the real food sa-safety situation and the efforts of our clean-up-the results of our clean-up efforts must be made public so that the people and media organizations can supervise the government’s efforts more fully and more effectively. This will also in a way force enterprises and the government to firm up our responsibilities and help the people to take some precautionary measures. Since we breathe the same air, then we have to work hard together. Everyone should pitch in and as far as the government concerned, we will show greater resolve and take actions to reassure the people. Thank you. \n",

      "(2) Phoenix TV of Hong Kong. I noticed one detail, Mr. Premier, in the course of the press conference, you have raised your hands over thirty times, which reminds me of the meeting I had with you 11 years ago. At that time, you were working in Henan Province. And during that meeting, I was impressed by your confidence and wisdom. The question is: In 2011, you visited Hong Kong and brought along a large gift box from the central government. What new measures will your government take to support Hong Kong’s development? And I myself, and my family also er descended from Anhui Province, I was born in Taiwan, I’m working in Hong Kong, and over the past decade and more, I have shuttled frequently between the mainland, Taiwan and Hong Kong. I know the people want to get a fuller understanding of you as a person, you have worked your way up from the lowest level of Chinese society to the highest echelon of government, can you talk about your personal experience and your personal philosophy?\n",

      "\n",
      "(0) But you asked a question about the three places. Uh these uh can raise a lot of emotions within me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "(3) In 2011, I made a visit to Hong Kong. During the trip, I announced the central government’s policies for supporting Hong Kong’s prosperity, and deepening cooperation between the mainland and Hong Kong. You described these policies as a large gift box, I think that’s a pretty good analogy. But to open the gift box, and to take out the solid gifts therein, we need to work together both the mainland and Hong Kong. Actually, some of these policies have already paid off and the central government will continue to do its best to advance our work. During the trip in 2011, I was deeply impressed by the fact that Hong Kong was brimming with vitality under “One country, Two systems”, our compatriots in Hong Kong are hard-working and smart. The Hong Kong society is open, inclusive and vibrant. and there is great space for deepening the cooperation between the mainland and Hong Kong, the central government will do its level best to advance-advance those initiatives that will enhance the well-being of our compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao, that deepen the cooperation between the mainland and Hong Kong and Macao that will contribute to the long term prosperity of Hong Kong and Macao.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) You asked about my personal experience and mentioned Anhui in your question, I was once a sent-town youth in Fengyang County in Anhui province. I won’t forget the hard times I have spent with the local peasants. Fengyang was known for its poverty across the country and it was also the place where the rural household responsibility system reform originated. I still remember in 1977, I-when I was working in the fields, I learned of the news that I was enrolled by university. Reform and opening-up has changed the destiny of our nation and lifted hundreds of millions of peasants out of poverty. It has also changed the life course of many individuals, including me. Now the heavy responsibility of reform has fallen on the shoulders of our generation, we will do our best to make sure that the dividends of reform will reach everyone in our society, so that the elderly will enjoy their old age, and the young will be full of hope, and our country will be full of vitality.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) I don’t have time to talk more about my personal experience, but in my life, through reading, through handling various matters and through my cultural upbring, I have learned the following: which is, to follow the great way, to put the people first and to benefit all under the heaven. You cannot find these exact words in any classical works, these are the things I have learned in my life. I am convinced that only by being upright, being conducting one’s self and only by being fair in handling affairs can one benefit the country and benefit the people. Thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "(0) I think we are running overtime, perhaps we’ll have just one last question.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "(0) I defer to the moderator and a lady and I respect every one of you here.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "(0) Russian International News Agency. You’ve answered a question about China-US relations, so let me raise one about China-Russia relations. President Xi Jinping will soon make a visit to Russia, Mr Premier, how do you look at China- Russia relations? And how do you intend to push forward the cooperation between the two countries?\n",
      "(1) Soon President Xi Jinping will make a visit to Russia, this in itself shows how important our bilateral relationship is. China and Russia are each other’s biggest neighbor. I remember when I made a visit to Russia last year myself, the Russian leader were very straightforward with me. They say, our political relations are in very good shape er there is nothing that we don’t agree on, so why don’t we spending more time talking about enhancing our practical cooperation. And in my contacts with local government personnel and people from outside the government, I get the strong sense that they have a strong desire to raise the level of practical cooperation and leverage the economic complementarity between the two sides. I remember during the trip,  I attended an economic and trade forum, I said that currently the bilateral trade stood at 80 billion US dollars, through our joint efforts may be we can more than double that in the years ahead and that will deliver benefits to both sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "(3) China and Russia will keep advancing our practical cooperation and step up communication and coordination on regional and international affairs. This will help to not just consolidate our bilateral relationship but maintain peace and stability in our region and the whole world. Let me say that China has been working with our neighboring countries, to advance mutually-beneficial cooperation and to take such cooperation to a new level by drawing on our respective strength, so that we can make peace, development and cooperation in Asia and in the Asia-pacific an irresistible trend.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "(4) Our moderator has said this is going to be the last question and I know many foreign journalists present today haven’t got an opportunity to raise questions. So let me just say a few more words. Recently I've been following very closely news reports about China er including the issues discussed by foreign media organizations. I think there are two main concerns. First, whether the Chinese economy will continue to grow sustainably? And secondly, whether a stronger China will become more assertive and even seek hegemony? \n",
      "(2) I think these two concerns are really unnecessary. China is capable of achieving sustainable and healthy economic development and pursuing social progress. And there are more than 1.3 billion people in this country. So we are on a long journey towards modernization. For that we will require an international environment of lasting peace. Even if China becomes stronger, we will not seek hegemony because we have learned from our own bitter experience in the modern period that one should not impose on others what he himself does not desire. This is an article of faith for us.\n",
      "\n",
      "(3) Let me underscore here that China has an unwavering commitment to peaceful development. We also have an unshakable determination to safeguard our country's sovereignty and territorial integrity. These two are not contradictory to each other. In fact, they are essential to regional stability and world peace. China will shoulder our due international obligations as a large developing country. We're willing to work with the countries of the world to maintain global peace and expand global prosperity in the 21st century. Thank you. \n",
      "(1) The moderator has again implicated to me that our time is really up. I know many of you came to this hall very early in the day. I know that without the press we would have no stories to read. So I really appreciate your hard work. I hope you will take care. I'm sure we'll have future opportunities to meet with each other. \n",
      "(0) Thank you again. Goodbye.\n",
