      "<p>    3月15日，国务院总理李克强在北京人民大会堂与中外记者见面，并回答记者提问。 新华社北京3月15日电 十二届全国人大三次会议15日上午在人民大会堂举行记者会，国务院总理李克强应大会发言人傅莹的邀请会见中外记者，并回答记者提问。</p>\n",
      "<p>    记者会开始时，李克强说，媒体界的各位朋友，女士们、先生们，在中国两会召开期间，你们做了大量工作，很辛苦。两会现在结束了，但你们的工作还不能结束，今天又是星期天，也不能休息，向你们表示衷心感谢！我愿意在这个场合回答大家的提问。</p>\n",
      "<p>    英国金融时报记者：去年中国的房地产市场一直在下滑，所以很多中国人都到海外去买房子。现在中国公民已经是纽约、悉尼、伦敦等地最大的海外顾客群体了，当地房价随之被明显抬高。也有一些人开始质疑从中国涌入当地市场资金的合法性。请问总理，中国政府会担心由此引发海外市场的强烈反应吗？今年政府是否会出台新政策来促进国内房地产市场？</p>\n",
      "<p>    李克强：中国正在逐步推进人民币资本项下的可兑换，这本身也表明，我们在推进资本市场的开放。但是你说有大量中国人到海外购房，而且成了某些热点城市的最大购买群体，这可能还需要做评估，我没有这方面确切的消息。我所了解到的是，去年是中国吸引外资力度最大的一年，进入中国的外资达到近1200亿美元。同时，我们也愿意看到中国企业“走出去”，中国公民到国外去创业，当然，既要遵守中国有关法律的规定，也要遵守当地的法律。</p>\n",
      "<p>    你是一位外国人，中文说得这么流利，不知道有没有在中国买房？当然，我们是欢迎的。中国还是一个发展中国家，住房既是经济问题，更是民生问题。中国政府要做的，就是要为低收入住房困难群体提供住房保障。今年，我们在改造棚户区、城市和农村危房方面还要加大力度，分别增加110万、100万套。中国政府有保障群众基本居住条件的责任。</p>\n",
      "<p>    房地产市场有其自身的规律。中国国土面积辽阔，有特大城市、中小城市和小城镇，情况各异，所以我们要求强化地方政府合理调控房地产市场的责任，因地制宜，分城施策。中国城镇化进程还在加快，房地产市场的需求是刚性的。我们支持居民自住性住房和改善性住房需求，促进房地产市场长期平稳健康发展。</p>\n",
      "<p>    《新京报》记者：我们注意到，您最近在多个场合力挺电子商务和快递等新业态，我很想知道您个人从网上买过东西吗？如果买过，最近买的是什么？另外，有人认为网购会冲击实体店，对此您怎么看？</p>\n",
      "<p>    李克强：在场的各位可能都有过网购的经历，我也不例外，也网购过，最近还买过几本书，书名我就不便说了，避免有做广告之嫌。但是我很愿意为网购、快递和电子商务等新业态做广告。因为它极大地带动了就业、创造了就业岗位，而且刺激了消费，人们在网上消费往往热情比较高。</p>\n",
      "<p>    至于网购是否会冲击实体店，我听到过这样的议论，开始也难免会有担心。但是，我曾经到一个网店集中的村庄去看过，那里800户人家开了2000多家网店，可见创业的空间有多大。同时，我又到了附近一个实体店集中的市场，我问他们有没有担心？实体店的老板给我看，他也开了网店，而且把自己实体店的状况拍成视频上网，他说这对购物者来说更有真实感，更有竞争力。可见，网上网下互动创造的是活力，是更大的空间。</p>\n",
      "<p>    这使我想起最近互联网上流行的一个词叫“风口”，我想站在“互联网+”的风口上顺势而为，会使中国经济飞起来。</p>\n",
      "<p>    我也想到，今天是“3·15”消费者权益日，不管是网上店还是网下的实体店，都要讲究诚信，保证质量，维护消费者的合法权益。</p>\n",
      "<p>    美国彭博新闻社记者：您多次提过需要有壮士断腕的决心来进行改革，您也说过这个过程可能会很疼。在中国经济放缓的今天，您会继续保持这样的决心吗？您认为中国经济会不会继续放缓？未来会不会更疼？</p>\n",
      "<p>    李克强：你问到疼，确实很疼，而且在加深，面还会扩大。因为简政放权是政府的自我革命，削权是要触动利益的，它不是剪指甲，是割腕，忍痛也得下刀。</p>\n",
      "<p>    简政放权有利于厘清政府和市场的关系，激发市场活力，也可以用它去顶住经济下行的压力。去年我国经济增速放缓，但是就业不减反增，简政放权起了很重要的支撑作用。</p>\n",
      "<p>    本届政府两年内下很大力气完成了当初提出的五年内砍掉三分之一行政审批事项的目标，其中有的是取消，有的是下放。我们推进商事制度改革后，每天就有上万家企业登记，比上年增加了近50%。可见，活力来自民间，而简政放权的减法可以为应对经济放缓产生支撑的力量。</p>\n",
      "<p>    当然，在这方面还有很多不落实的情况存在，推进中还发现了一些新的问题。前两天，我看到两会上有提案说，原来批个项目要一百多个章，虽然现在审批砍了一些，但还有五六十道关卡，还会增加创业的成本、抑制创造的热情。所以，我们必须继续下更大力气来推进简政放权。</p>\n",
      "<p>    今年政府要有新作为，重点要抓三个方面的工作：一是全面取消非行政许可，不能法外施权。另外，国家部门授权地方政府审批的事项还有1200多项，今年要砍掉200多项。不能像开车一样，松了手刹，还踩着脚刹，明放暗不放。二是要推进权力清单、责任清单，今年是在省一级公布，明年推向市县一级，晾晒清单，让社会监督，也让老百姓明白，权力不能滥用。三是要探索事中事后监管的新模式，包括扩大综合执法试点，对假冒伪劣、坑蒙拐骗、食品安全方面以及侵犯知识产权等行为要有有效的监管方式。</p>\n",
      "<p>    人们不是常说，穿鞋要合脚，施政也要利民惠民。</p>\n",
      "<p>    中央人民广播电台记者：2014年中国的反腐行动已经使多只“大老虎”落网了，您认为如何从制度建设方面入手，进一步推动反腐？另外，您还说过懒政怠政也是一种腐败，究竟怎么样才能解决官员的不作为问题？</p>\n",
      "<p>    李克强：中国党和政府一贯坚持反腐倡廉的方针。党的十八大以来，以习近平同志为总书记的党中央坚持有腐必反、有贪必惩。一些所谓位高权重的人被依法调查和处理，成效是明显的，人民群众也是拥护的。</p>\n",
      "<p>    所以，推进制度反腐和标本兼治是一致的。首先还是要依法治国。法律面前人人平等，不论是谁都不能在法外用权。二是要推进体制改革。比如简政放权很重要的一个目的就是坚决打掉寻租空间，铲除腐败土壤，因为很多腐败分子一个共同的特征就是寻租。三是要加强监督和教育。让权力在阳光下运行，受到社会的监督，公职人员要提高自律意识，以权谋公而不能谋私。在这个过程当中，我们既要惩治乱作为，也反对不作为，庸政懒政是不允许的。门好进了、脸好看了，就是不办事，这是为官不为啊，必须严肃问责。</p>\n",
      "<p>    新加坡《海峡时报》记者：中国政府已经将2015年中国经济增速的预期目标定在7%左右，表示想要实现一种新常态的经济增长，这种增长虽然速缓，但是质更优。我想了解的是，中国从这样的新常态中能够获得怎样的益处？这种新常态的增长对于中国、对于整个世界会有何影响？您对于新常态增长是怎么看的？您对中国坚持实现速缓但质优的新常态增长是否抱有信心？</p>\n",
      "<p>    李克强：中国经济进入新常态，我们经济增速调整为今年预期增长7%左右，看起来增速是调低了，实际上实现这个目标并不容易，因为中国的经济总量增大了，已经超过了十万亿美元。如果按7%增长，那每年就要增加一个中等国家的经济规模。在这个过程中，如果我们能够注重质量、效益，促使中国经济由中低端向中高端升级，那就可以在较长时期保持中国经济中高速增长。我们实现现代化就有了坚实的基础，对世界也是巨大的贡献。</p>\n",
      "<p>    你的提问当中实际上表现了一种担心，刚才美国彭博社记者提问当中也问中国经济会不会继续放缓。我多次说过，在新常态下，我们会保持中国经济在合理区间运行。如果速度放缓影响了就业收入等，逼近合理区间的下限，我们会在稳定政策与稳定市场对中国长期预期的同时，加大定向调控的力度，来稳定当期市场的信心。我们这几年没有采取短期强刺激的政策，可以说运用政策的回旋余地还比较大，我们“工具箱”里的工具还比较多。</p>\n",
      "<p>    我希望你们对我后一段话的理解是“如果”。当然，我并不否认，中国经济面临着下行的压力，有多重风险，关键在于新常态下要在稳增长和调结构中间找到平衡点，这就使我想起中国人发明的围棋，讲究既要谋势，又要做活，而做活需要“两只眼”。形象地讲，稳增长和调结构就是“两只眼”，做活了就可以谋大势，当然这需要眼光、耐力和勇气。我相信，大家同心协力，有能力保持中国经济的大盘、基本面持续向好。</p>\n",
      "<p>    《第一财经日报》记者：我们注意到您多次强调大众创业、万众创新，认为这是中国经济的新引擎。但是，也有人说，创业是老百姓自己的事，是市场的行为，那么我们的政府为什么还要操这么大的心、用这么大的力呢？</p>\n",
      "<p>    李克强：谢谢你的好意，让我们少操心。但是不能不多操心啊，因为大众创业、万众创新，实际上是一种改革，这也是历史的启示。回想30多年前，正是因为承包制政策的实施，调动了亿万农民生产和经营的积极性，也因为允许人口流动，亿万农民工进城，创造了中国经济的奇迹。</p>\n",
      "<p>    我想起去年在我们推进简政放权、商事制度改革的时候，我去一个地方的企业登记场所，遇到一位已经退休的妇女。因为我们取消了注册资本的实缴制，她的热情来了，说要办一个婚庆公司，而且她说：“我知道这个地方办婚礼的老礼数，有些家庭希望这么办，我没有读过很多书，但这是我的核心竞争力。”我还到访过一些咖啡屋、众创空间，看到那里年轻人有许多奇思妙想，他们研发的产品可以说能够带动市场的需求。真是高手在民间啊，破茧就可以成蝶。</p>\n",
      "<p>    市场活力的激发需要政府去清障搭台，今年我们要继续在这方面做更多的事。要进一步放宽市场准入，实行“三证合一”，让服务业领域的一些企业注册登记别再那么费劲了。要为创业搭台，对企业特别是创业型小微企业，我们要更多地提供租金低廉的创业空间，给创业插上翅膀，还要通过政府引导资金来吸引更多的种子基金。同时，还要进一步减税降费，让这些企业轻装前进。</p>\n",
      "<p>    国家的繁荣在于人民创造力的发挥，经济的活力也来自就业、创业和消费的多样性。我们推动“双创”，就是要让更多的人富起来，让更多的人实现人生价值。这有助于调整收入分配结构，促进社会公平，也会让更多的年轻人，尤其是贫困家庭的孩子有更多的上升通道。</p>\n",
      "<p>    美国《赫芬顿邮报》记者：中石化、中石油这两个央企一直在妨碍环保政策的制定和执行，尤其是汽油质量标准的确定和天然气的推行。您认为这两个央企真的在阻碍环保政策的落实吗？如果这样的话，中央政府会怎么冲破这种阻力？</p>\n",
      "<p>    李克强：我理解你刚才一连串的发问，问的是人们包括在座各位普遍关注的雾霾等环境污染这个焦点问题。可以说，政府在治理雾霾等环境污染方面决心是坚定的，也下了很大的气力，但取得的成效与人们的期待还有比较大的差距。我在去年《政府工作报告》中说，要向雾霾等污染“宣战”，不达目的决不“停战”。</p>\n",
      "<p>    治理环境污染要抓住关键，今年的要害就是要严格执行新出台的环境保护法。对违法违规排放的企业，不论是什么样的企业，坚决依法追究，甚至要让那些偷排偷放的企业承受付不起的代价。对环保执法部门要加大支持力度，包括能力建设，不允许有对执法的干扰和法外施权。环保等执法部门也要敢于担当，承担责任。对工作不到位、工作不力的也要问责，渎职失职的要依法追究。环保法的执行不是“棉花棒”，是“杀手锏”。</p>\n",
      "<p>    当然，治理环境污染是一个系统工程。我前些天看到有个别媒体报道说，今年《政府工作报告》关于雾霾等环境污染治理的表述放在比较靠后的位置。我想说明，今年报告有很大的变化，就是我们把节能减排的指标和主要经济社会发展指标排列在一起，放在了很靠前的位置。报告从调结构到提高油品生产和使用的质量等，都和治理雾霾等环境污染相关联，这是一个需要全社会人人有责的治理行动。当然，治理要有个过程，如果说人一时难以改变自己所处的自然环境，但是可以改变自己的行为方式。</p>\n",
      "<p>    中央电视台记者：中国经济进入新常态之后，人口规模和人口结构怎样与之相适应、相匹配？去年出台实施了“单独二孩”政策后，社会上又出现了要求全面放开二孩的声音，这在今年两会上也是一个热点话题。请问总理，全面放开二孩会是国家生育政策调整完善未来一个确定的方向吗？如果是的话，有没有具体的时间表？</p>\n",
      "<p>    李克强：你谈到人口政策，去年我们已经开始实施“单独二孩”政策，现在正在推进，也正在进行全面的评估。我们会根据评估的结果，也考虑中国经济社会发展和人口结构变化的情况，权衡利弊，依照法律程序适时调整和完善人口政策。</p>\n",
      "<p>    日本《朝日新闻》记者：今年是战后70周年，我想了解总理的历史观。另外到日本的中国游客现在有所增加，在日本购买很多东西，但是到中国的日本游客比以前减少，日本的对华投资也减少，您怎么分析这种现象？如何看待中国有关70周年的纪念活动，包括大阅兵给日本国民的对华感情带来的影响？</p>\n",
      "<p>    李克强：今年是中国人民抗日战争和世界反法西斯战争胜利70周年，不仅中国，世界上许多国家都要开展多种形式的纪念活动，目的是要牢记这一惨痛的历史悲剧，不让历史重演，维护二战胜利成果和战后国际秩序及一系列国际法，以维系人类持久和平。</p>\n",
      "<p>    当前，中日关系的确比较困难，根子还是在于对那场战争、对历史的认识，并能否始终保持正确的认识。坚持正确的历史观，就是要以史为鉴、面向未来。对于一个国家的领导人来说，不仅要继承前人所创造的成就，也应该担负起前人罪行所带来的历史责任。当年，日本军国主义强加给中国人民的那场侵略战争，给我们带来了巨大的灾难，最终日本民众也是受害者。在今年这样一个重要的时刻，我认为对中日关系既是检验，也是机遇。如果日本领导人正视历史，并且保持一贯，改善和发展中日关系就有新的契机，也自然会给中日经贸关系的发展创造良好的条件。</p>\n",
      "<p>    新华社记者：去年以来银行不良贷款在持续攀升，影子银行风险事件时有发生，同时一些地方陆续出现了还债高峰。一方面我们经济下行的压力在加大，另一方面金融风险也在累积。请问您对此怎么看？</p>\n",
      "<p>    李克强：刚才同时站起来两个人，你提了两个以上的问题，集中是在金融风险上。中国的确存在着个案性的金融风险，但是我们完全可以守住不发生系统性、区域性金融风险。这是因为中国的经济还处于合理区间，而且我们的储蓄率比较高，地方政府性债务70%以上是投资性的，是有收益的，而且我们也正在规范债务平台，堵后门、开正门。就银行来说，资本充足率较高，拨备覆盖面也较广。虽然不良贷款也略有上升，但是在世界上仍处于比较低的水平。</p>\n",
      "<p>    这里我要表明，我们允许个案性金融风险的发生，按市场化的原则进行清算，这是为了防止道德风险，也能增强人们的风险意识。今年，我们就要出台存款保险制度，而且要进一步发展多层次的资本市场，降低企业的资金杠杆率，使金融更好地为实体经济服务。</p>\n",
      "<p>    台湾无线卫星电视台（TVBS）记者：去年在台湾发生的一些事情，影响到两岸经济合作的进程。在大陆经济结构调整、经济增速放缓的趋势下，在大陆的台商也遇到一些经营和发展上的困难。请问大陆在继续促进两岸经济合作过程中有什么策略，可以让台湾的企业家和台湾一般民众更优先而切实地感受到大陆发展的机遇？</p>\n",
      "<p>    李克强：两岸是一家人，是骨肉同胞。坚持“一个中国”、“九二共识”、反对“台独”，维护两岸关系和平发展，就会给两岸经济合作创造基础，扩大空间。对推动两岸经济合作来说，需要“两个轮子”一起转。一个轮子就是要加强两岸经贸合作的制度化建设，比如说像ECFA（《海峡两岸经济合作框架协议》）后续协商。另一个轮子就是扩大相互开放。对大陆来说，尤其是要重视在大陆投资的台湾企业。</p>\n",
      "<p>    这里请你传递一个带有“定心丸”的消息，就是大陆将会继续维护台资企业和台商的合法权益，保持对他们的合理优惠政策。而且在对外开放中，我们会先一步对台湾开放，或者说对台湾开放的力度和深度会更大一些。我们欢迎台胞特别是年轻人到大陆来创业，并且愿意推动两岸人员交流，拉近两岸民众的心理距离。</p>\n",
      "<p>    韩国广播公司（KBS）记者：近几个月中国CPI涨幅一直维持在1.5%左右，今年1月更是只有0.8%，我觉得中国已经进入通货紧缩，有一种说法说中国是全球通货紧缩的输出者，对韩国也有影响，对此您怎么看？</p>\n",
      "<p>    李克强：关于通货紧缩，国际上有多种解释，比较一致的就是说一个国家的物价总水平持续出现负增长。中国CPI或者说物价总水平1月份是正增长，2月份涨幅比1月份高，所以不能说中国已经出现了通货紧缩。</p>\n",
      "<p>    虽然中国现在的物价总水平比较低，但并不是中国向世界输出了通缩，你说叫“输出者”，实际上我们是“被通缩”。我给你举个例子，去年，我们进口了3.1亿吨原油、9.3亿吨铁矿石，量是增的，没有跌，但是价格下来了，主要是因为国际大宗商品价格大幅度下跌。对这种“被通缩”的问题，我们有应对，也有进一步的准备。当然，我们更希望世界经济能走出低迷，实现复苏。</p>\n",
      "<p>    《中国日报》记者：近期我们注意到国际上有一种看法，认为中国已经成为世界上最大的经济体，一方面挑战了美国的领导地位，另一方面在很多国际事务上中国仍然在搭便车，请问您怎么看待这样的看法？此外，对于推进中美关系，我们也想听听您的想法。</p>\n",
      "<p>    李克强：首先，关于中国是不是最大的世界经济体。我在国外也经常听到这种说法，总是有被“忽悠”的感觉。因为按照国际权威统计，中国也就是世界第二大经济体。更重要的是，按人均GDP，我们是在世界80位以后。就在前不久的春节前，我去中国西部一个农村，连走两户人家。一家母子二人，住在四面透风的破瓦房里，儿子40多岁了，因为穷还没有娶上媳妇。再到另一家，好不容易出了一个大学生，但是他的妹妹为了让哥哥更好地念书，春节还在外面打工没有回家。我看了确实很心痛。这样的例子还很多，如果按照世界银行的标准，中国还有近2亿贫困人口，中国是实实在在的发展中国家。</p>\n",
      "<p>    中国把自己的事办好，保持合理的发展，本身就是对世界巨大的贡献。而且中国还在越来越多地承担应尽的国际责任和义务。要说中国搭便车，这么大的块头搭谁的便车？中国是和大家一起推车。</p>\n",
      "<p>    中国以发展为第一要务，需要一个和平的国际环境。讲到中美关系，这是最大发展中国家和最大发达国家之间的关系。我们愿意构建不冲突、不对抗、相互尊重、合作共赢的新型大国关系。今年习近平主席将应邀对美国进行国事访问，相信会进一步推进中美关系的发展。</p>\n",
      "<p>    毋庸讳言，中美之间存有分歧，但更有广泛的共同利益。妥善处理分歧，可以着力扩大利益的交汇点。这里面有个很大的亮点，就是我们正在推进中美投资协定谈判，它是以准入前国民待遇和负面清单为基础的，这本身就是打破双边经贸合作的天花板，开辟发展的新空间。当然，谈判会有个过程，但它向中美、向世界发出了明确的信号，就是中美经贸关系会更加密切，这个中美关系的“压舱石”会更沉更稳。</p>\n",
      "<p>    香港《经济日报》记者：我的问题和香港民众关心的政改问题有关。现在距离政改投票越来越近了，但是中央领导人近期不断作出强硬的表态，这使很多人对政改方案通过并不乐观。您在今年的《政府工作报告》中首次提到要严格依照宪法和基本法办事，请问这是否意味着中央会进一步收紧对港政策？两地之间文化和经济交流等方面会不会受到影响？会不会增加一些变数？</p>\n",
      "<p>    李克强：“一国两制”、“港人治港”、“澳人治澳”、高度自治，这是中国的一项基本国策。有人担心中央政府会不会收紧对香港的政策，这是不必要的。今年《政府工作报告》讲到，要严格依照宪法和基本法办事，本身就说明要一以贯之地把“一国两制”实施好、贯彻好。因为“一国两制”写进了宪法和基本法，宪法和基本法共同构成了特别行政区的宪制基础，基本法也规定了特别行政区实行的制度。“一国两制”是国家的意志和人民的意愿，不能随意改变。我说这些话，可能有些人听起来感觉到像是字斟句酌，因为你问了一个涉及法律的问题，我必须认真地回答。</p>\n",
      "<p>    中央政府会继续支持香港特别行政区政府和行政长官依法施政，也会继续加大对香港的支持力度，继续发挥香港在国家改革开放和现代化建设中的独特作用，使香港、内地在交流合作当中都更多受益，进一步深化经贸和文化交流，使两地民众都满意，增进两地人民的福祉。</p>\n",
      "<p>    奥地利国家广播电视台记者：中国奉行什么样的外交政策，欧洲高度关注。我们看到，现在俄罗斯军队还在乌克兰。请问中国在这个问题上持什么样的立场？是否认为这违反国际法？几天前在俄罗斯国内电视媒体上，普京总统讲述了他当时是如何规划俄罗斯进入克里米亚这个行动的，中国现在视克里米亚是俄罗斯的一部分还是乌克兰的一部分？</p>\n",
      "<p>    李克强：中国始终奉行独立自主的和平外交政策。在乌克兰问题上一直保持着客观、公正的立场，我们尊重乌克兰的独立、主权和领土完整。前不久，我在欧洲同乌克兰总统会面，对他说了这段话。他问能不能对外公布？我说没问题，你可以把我的原话登到报纸上。同时，乌克兰问题给地缘政治确实带来了复杂性，尤其是影响了世界经济的复苏进程，我们还是希望这个问题能够通过对话、谈判、协商解决。至于克里米亚问题，成因比较复杂，我们同样希望能够用对话的方式政治解决。我们希望看到邻居之间都和睦相处，欧洲和其他国家共同发展、合作共赢的局面，这既有利于相关方，也有利于中国。</p>\n",
      "<p>    《人民日报》记者：您提到最近一次网购经历是在网上买书，我的问题与书有关。因为我们都知道《政府工作报告》要写的东西很多，每年都有变化，但是我们注意到连续两年把“全民阅读”写入了《政府工作报告》，我不知道您为什么对这件事那么看重？能否跟我们分享一下您的读书感受？</p>\n",
      "<p>    李克强：我记得去年起草《政府工作报告》，我在听取各方意见的时候，不仅是文化界、出版界的人士，而且经济界和企业家都向我提出要支持全民阅读活动，报告要加上“全民阅读”的字样。而且还有人担忧，说现在我们国家民众每年的阅读量还不到有些国家人均的十分之一。这些建议让我深思，说明人们不仅在追求物质财富的增加，而且希望有更丰富的精神生活。</p>\n",
      "<p>    书籍和阅读可以说是人类文明传承的主要载体。就我个人的经历来说，用闲暇时间来阅读是一种享受，也是拥有一种财富，可以说终身受益。我希望全民阅读能够形成一种氛围，无处不在。我们国家全民的阅读量能够逐年增加，这也是我们社会进步、文明程度提高的十分重要的标志。而且把阅读作为一种生活方式，把它与工作方式相结合，不仅会增加发展的创新力量，而且会增强社会的道德力量。这也就是为什么我两次把“全民阅读”这几个字写入《政府工作报告》的原因，明年还会继续。</p>\n",
      "<p>    主持人宣布记者会结束后，有一位记者追问如何看待中缅边境最近发生的问题，李克强说，你问了一件让我感到痛心的事情。在中缅边界我方一侧，一些我国居民的生命和财产受到了损失，我首先要向遇难者表示深切哀悼，向其家属表示深切慰问。我国外交部、军方都向缅方提出了严正交涉。我们有责任也有能力坚决维护中缅边境的安全稳定，坚决保护我国人民的生命和财产安全。</p>\n",
      "<p>    记者会在人民大会堂三楼金色大厅举行，历时约2小时。参加采访的中外记者近900名。</p>\n",

      "<p>The Third Session of the 12th National People&rsquo;s Congress held a press conference at the Great Hall of the People on the morning of 15th March 2015. Premier Li Keqiang of the State Council met with Chinese and foreign press and answered questions at invitation of spokeswoman of the NPC session Fu Ying.</p>\n",
      "<p>At the start of the press conference, Premier Li Keqiang said: Friends from the press, ladies and gentlemen, you have made tremendous efforts to cover the NPC and CPPCC sessions, The two sessions have come to a close, but your work has not. Today is Sunday yet you cannot take the day off. I want to use this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation to you all. Now I would be happy to answer your questions.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Financial Times:<span style=\" font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; ;\"> Last year, China&rsquo;s real estate market has been in decline. This has prompted a large number of Chinese to start buying homes overseas. Currently, Chinese customers have become the largest group of home-buyers in New York, Sydney and London. And this has significantly driven up local home prices. Some people have called into question the legitimacy of the money spent there. Are you concerned about a backlash to such massive home-buying by the Chinese overseas? And will the Chinese government introduce new policy measures to boost the domestic real estate market this year?</span>\n",
      "</strong>\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Li Keqiang</strong>: China is working towards full convertibility of renminbi under capital accounts. This shows that China is taking further steps to open up its capital market. You talked about the phenomenon of a large number of Chinese buying homes overseas and said that they have become the largest home-buyers in a number of international metropolises. I suppose more evaluation needs to be done here as to whether that is true. And I&rsquo;m not in possession of solid information about this. But what I know is that China is still the largest destination of foreign direct investment. And the number last year was 120 billion US dollars. At the same time, the Chinese government will continue to encourage Chinese companies and nationals to make investment and do business overseas. And in doing so, they need to abide by China&rsquo;s relevant laws and the laws of host countries.</p>\n",
      "<p>You have a Westerner&rsquo;s face, but you speak Chinese so well. I wonder if you have bought home in China. You are welcome to do so. China is still a large developing country. Housing is not just an economic issue, but also one that concerns people&rsquo;s livelihood. The Chinese government needs to help the low-income people resolve housing difficulty. The government will take more steps to rebuild urban rundown areas and dilapidated homes in urban and rural areas. And the plan this year is an additional one million units each. It is the government&rsquo;s responsibility to meet the people&rsquo;s basic housing needs.</p>\n",
      "<p>The real estate market is governed by its own laws. China is such a large country. There are mega cities, medium- and small-sized cities as well as small townships in this big country. Conditions of these different cities and townships vary significantly from one to another. Hence, the central government has required that local governments fulfill their responsibility to exercise appropriate regulation of real estate markets. Differentiated policies will be adopted in the light of local conditions. At the same time, urbanization is still picking up speed in China. Hence the housing demand in China is here to stay. We also encourage Chinese people to buy homes for personal use or improved living conditions. We hope to see steady and sound growth of the real estate market in the long run. </p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Beijing News: <span style=\" font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; ;\">Mr. Premier, on many occasions, you have expressed your strong support for new forms of business, like e-commerce and express delivery service. So I&rsquo;m very curious. Have you ever shopped online? And, what did you buy? Some people are worried that online shopping will adversely affect physical stores. What is your view about this?</span>\n",
      "</strong>\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Li Keqiang</strong>: I suppose that each and every one of you here has had experience of shopping online. And I&rsquo;m no exception. Yes, I have bought things on the Internet. Actually, I bought a few books recently. As for what books, I don&rsquo;t think it will be a good idea for me to spell them out here. No advertisement. Having said that, I would be happy to advertise for those new forms of business like online shopping, express delivery services and e-commerce, because these new forms of business give a strong boost to employment and consumption. And people seem to get quite excited when they shop online.</p>\n",
      "<p>I am aware of the worry that online shopping will adversely affect physical stores. It was only natural to have such worry at the beginning. But I recall a field trip that I paid to a local village in China. It&rsquo;s a village home to about 800 families who have opened some 2,000 shops on the Internet. One can well imagine how vast the space for business entrepreneurship there is. And after that I went to a close-by place where there&rsquo;s a large number of physical stores. And I asked one of the shop-owners that if he was concerned about any adverse effect from online shopping. The owner showed me that he has also opened an online shop and even uploaded a video of his physical shop online to show that the store is real and competitive. Such sound interaction between online and offline has only boosted the vitality of market.</p>\n",
      "<p>To borrow a popular idea on the Internet that everyone stands a chance to fly when there is a favorable wind blowing from behind, I believe with the tailwinds generated by our &ldquo;Internet+&rdquo; strategy, we will be able to get the Chinese economy off to a higher level.</p>\n",
      "<p>Today, March 15th, is the day for protecting the rights and interests of consumers. I hope all stores, be it online or offline, will do honest business, put quality of products before everything else and protect the rights and interests of all consumers. </p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Bloomberg News</strong>: You once said that the government needs to show utmost determination in reforming itself and this process could be a quite painful one. As the Chinese economy comes under increased downward pressure, do you still have as firm determination as before to carry out this reform, and will the Chinese economy continue to slide? Is more pain to come in the future?</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Li Keqiang</strong>: You asked about the pain caused by the government&rsquo;s self-imposed reform to streamline administration and delegate powers. Let me tell you that the pain is still there. Actually the pain is becoming more acute and is being felt in more places. This is a reform targeted at the government itself. As the government sheds its own powers, vested interests will be upset. This is not nail-clipping, but taking knife to one&rsquo;s own flesh. But however painful it may be, we are determined to keep going until our job is done. </p>\n",
      "<p>The reform of streamlining administration and delegating government powers helps us get the relationship right between the government and the market. It helps boost market vitality, and puts us in a stronger position to cope with downward pressures on economic growth. Last year, in spite of economic slowdown, we managed to add more urban jobs. Much is attributable to this reform. </p>\n",
      "<p>We have completed the five-year task of cancelling and delegating State Council review items by one third within just two years. With the reform of the business system, on average, up to 10,000 new businesses get registered each day, an increase of 50%. This fully shows that our people represents the largest source of vitality for economic growth, and this reform, by reducing the powers held in the hands of the government, has actually helped us to tackle the downward pressures on economic growth.</p>\n",
      "<p>We also recognize that some measures have yet to be fully implemented, and new problems have surfaced. A couple of days ago, I came across a proposal during the two sessions which said that although government review items have been slashed, to get one project approved, which needed up to 100 stamps from different government departments, still requires some 50 to 60 steps nowadays. The long procedures have driven up the cost of business start-up and dampened people&rsquo;s enthusiasm for making innovations. That is why the government must step up its efforts to streamline administration and delegate more powers.</p>\n",
      "<p>New steps will be taken this year and our focus is on the following three areas. First, all non-governmental review items will be canceled. We must ensure that government power will not be exercised when it is not stipulated by the law. There are currently over 1,200 review items at the local governments&rsquo; level, mandated by the central governmental departments. Our goal is to cut this number by over 200 this year. The government must not secretly hold on to powers that should be delegated, just like releasing the hand brake but still keeping the foot brake on. Second, all provincial-level governments will be required to release their list of powers and list of responsibilities this year. And this task will be assigned to governments in cities and city-level counties next year. We must keep our people well-informed of what powers their governments hold and put government power under public oversight to prevent the abuse of office. And third, we will explore new models for strengthening ongoing and ex-post regulation. We will expand the trials for integrated law-enforcement and we will establish effective models for exercising regulation over such acts as cheating and swindling of marketplace, violating intellectual property rights, making and selling fake and substandard goods, and cases involving food safety.</p>\n",
      "<p>Just as shoes must suit the feet, our administration must meet peoples&rsquo; needs and deliver real benefits.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>China National Radio</strong>: China&rsquo;s anti-corruption campaign in 2014 brought down several &ldquo;big tigers&rdquo; or high-ranking corrupt officials. I would like to know what more steps will be taken to enhance institution building in fighting corruption? You once said that it is also corruption for government officials to be indolent or sloppy in performing their duties. So what steps should we take to resolve the problem involving those &ldquo;do-nothing&rdquo; officials?</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Li Keqiang</strong>: The Communist Party of China and the Chinese government are committed to combating corruption and upholding integrity. Since the 18th National Party Congress, the Central Committee of the CPC with comrade Xi Jinping as General Secretary has been taking strong efforts to ensure that all acts of corruption will be brought to account. In this process, a number of high-ranking corrupt officials have been investigated and dealt with. Our efforts have yielded good results and won people&rsquo;s support.</p>\n",
      "<p>To enhance institution building in fighting corruption helps us to address both the symptom and root cause of corruption. First, we must run the country in accordance with the law, and ensure that every one is equal before the law and no one is above the law. Second, we need to press ahead with the reform of the administrative system. Just now I mentioned the reform of the government to streamline administration and delegate powers. This is to eliminate room for rent-seeking to remove the breeding ground for corruption, as rent seeking is a common feature of various kinds of corruption. Third, supervision and educational campaigns will be strengthened. We must make sure that government power is exercised in a transparent way and subject to public oversight. All civil servants must enhance their self-discipline and government power can only be used for public good, not personal gains. There must be no irresponsible action or inaction on the part of government officials, and there is no room for incompetence or indolence either. No government official should be half-hearted in doing their jobs. Such officials will be held accountable.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Straits Times</strong>: Premier Li, my question is about China&rsquo;s economy. China has set a lower GDP growth target this year of around 7%. Some say that it signals that Chinese economy has entered what they call a &ldquo;new normal&rdquo; of slower but better quality growth. What are the benefits knowing there are also downsides of slowing Chinese economy? Can you tell us how this new normal will affect China and the world? How should we view this and can we have the confidence that China is still committed to this new normal and can mange it well? </p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Li Keqiang</strong>: China&rsquo;s economic development has entered a new normal. This year we have set the GDP growth target at approximately 7%. The GDP growth target has been adjusted downward, but it will by no means be easy to meet this target. Because China&rsquo;s economic aggregate keeps expanding and now the size of the economy is valued about 10 trillion US dollars. So a seven percent increase in today&rsquo;s economy is equivalent to the economic aggregate of a medium-sized country. We want to upgrade China&rsquo;s economy to a medium-high level of development and pursue a growth with improved quality and performance. This will help maintain China&rsquo;s growth at a medium-high speed and lay a more solid foundation for us to achieve modernization. It will also be China&rsquo;s big contribution to global economic growth.</p>\n",
      "<p>I sense some elements of concern in your question about China&rsquo;s economic growth and when the journalist from Bloomberg asked his questions, there was also such a worry about slowing growth in China. I have said on many occasions that under this new normal, we need to ensure that China&rsquo;s economy operates within a proper range. And if the growth speed comes close to the lower limit of the proper range and affects employment and increase of people&rsquo;s income, we will step up targeted macro economic regulation to boost the current market confidence while maintaining the continuity of our macro economic policies to anchor long-term market expectations. The good news is that in the past couple of years, we did not resort to massive stimulus measures for economic growth, and that has given us ample room to exercise macro economic regulation and we still have a host of policy instruments at our disposal.</p>\n",
      "<p>The latter part of my remarks is about a hypothetical situation. At the same time, I recognize that there is considerable downward pressure on China&rsquo;s growth and we still face multiple risks. This requires that the government strike a proper balance between maintaining steady growth and making structural adjustments. In Weiqi, a chessboard game invented by the Chinese, one needs to both plan on the big side and get key moves right. When it comes to the economy, we must meet both ends of maintaining steady growth and making structural adjustments. And this way, we can get a handle on the big situation. This requires that we have vision, perseverance and courage. I have confidence that with joint efforts, we are able to maintain the long-term positive fundamentals of the overall Chinese economy.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>China Business News</strong>: Mr. Premier, you have stressed the importance of mass entrepreneurship and innovation on many occasions, and see it as a new engine fueling China&rsquo;s economic growth. But some people say that it is a personal decision to start a business and it is a market behavior. So why should the government spend so much time and energy on this?</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Li Keqiang</strong>: I appreciate your good intention of saving the government time and energy, but this is something the government must do. Mass entrepreneurship and innovation is in itself a reform endeavor. This reform is inspred by the experience we have drawn from the past. Over the past more than 30 years, it is the introduction of household contract responsibility system that has brought into full play the initiative of the vast number of Chinese farmers. It is because our people could move freely across provinces and cities that several hundred million farmers have migrated into cities to find jobs. This has created the miracle of China&rsquo;s economic development. </p>\n",
      "<p>Last year when the government launched the reform of the business system to streamline its administration, I recall that I paid a visit to one of the local venues for business registration where I talked with a woman who has retired. As you may know, the government has replaced the paid-in capital registration requirement with subscribed capital registration. This has boosted our people&rsquo;s enthusiasm to start their own businesses. This woman is one of them. She told me that she wanted to register a wedding service company because she was well-versed in the local traditional wedding customs. She told me that some couples wanted to have a traditional wedding, so she believed that though she had not attended university, she had a competitive edge in providing such services. I also visited some ventures cafes and makerspaces where I see that the young people there all have brilliant ideas. When their ideas are put into practice and produce actual products, they are boosting market demand. I believe there are a large number of such people with outstanding talent in China. We must lift all the restrictions so that they can put their talent to best use.</p>\n",
      "<p>To boost market vitality, the government must eliminate road blocks and pave the way for people to tap their entrepreneurship. The government plans to do more in this regard this year. Market access will be further relaxed. Business license and all the required certificates will be integrated into one. It would no longer take one so much trouble to register a business in some areas of the services sector. The government also needs to foster more favorable conditions for business start-up. There needs to be low-rent makerspaces to add wings to the entrepreneurship of our people. The government will also fully leverage the national guidance fund to encourage more seed capital to pitch in. Taxes and fees will be further reduced to ensure that all businesses get to forge ahead with a light pack. </p>\n",
      "<p>A country could achieve prosperity when its people&rsquo;s initiative is brought into full play. There will be much economic vitality when there are ample business opportunities and choices for consumers. By encouraging mass entrepreneurship and innovation, we want to help more people become better off and enable more to achieve their full potential in life. This will also help us adjust the income distribution structure and promote social fairness. In particular, we want to ensure that young people, especially children from poor families, will have equal access to opportunities for upward mobility. </p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Huffington Post</strong>: Big oil companies like Sinopec and PetroChina have been an obstacle to formulating and implementing the policies on environmental protection, especially in setting the quality standards of gasoline and promoting wider use of natural gas. Is it true that these companies are posing an obstacle to carrying out environmental protection policies? If so, what steps will the Chinese government take to remove such an obstacle?</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Li Keqiang</strong>: I understand the focus of all your questions is about tackling environmental pollution, especially smog, a concern that is uppermost on all people&rsquo;s minds. I want to tell you that the Chinese government is determined to tackle smog and environmental pollution as a whole, and tremendous efforts have been made in this regard. But the progress achieved still falls far short of the expectation of our people. Last year, I said that the Chinese government would declare war against environmental pollution. We are determined to carry forward our efforts until we achieve our goal. </p>\n",
      "<p>We must get the focus of our efforts right. This year, our focus will be to ensure full implementation of the newly revised environmental protection law. All acts of illegal production and emissions will be brought to account. We will make the cost for doing so too high to bear. More support will be given to the law enforcement departments, such as in capacity building. No one must use his power to meddle with law enforcement. The law enforcement departments also need to have the courage to take charge and fulfill their due responsibilities. Laxity in law enforcement will be dealt with and dereliction of duties or abuse of office will be handled in accordance with the law. We must make sure that the law will work as a powerful and effective tool in fighting pollution instead of being as soft as cotton candy. </p>\n",
      "<p>To tackle environmental pollution is a systemic project that involves a lot of efforts across areas. A few days ago I came across a media report which said that in this year&rsquo;s government work report, the paragraph addressing environmental treatment came quite in the back. But I want to draw your attention to one big difference in this year&rsquo;s government work report. That is our targets for energy conservation and emission reduction are put together with all the major targets of economic and social development and they are together put in the front part of the report. Actually, many parts of the report, be it adjusting economic structure or improving the quality of fuel, all have something to do with environmental treatment. To tackle pollution takes a process and requires the joint efforts of the whole of society. It may be difficult for one to change the natural environment he lives in anytime soon, but one can always change the way he behaves. </p>\n",
      "<p><strong>CCTV</strong>: As China&rsquo;s economic development enters a new normal, people are also thinking how we can bring our demographic scale and structure compatible with the new normal. Last year, married couples can have a second child if one of the parents is a single child. During this year&rsquo;s two sessions, many people are calling for fully lifting the second-child restrictions and this is also a hot topic during the two sessions. I would like to ask if this is one of the goals on the government&rsquo;s agenda in reforming its family planning policy. If so, is there a time table for that to happen?</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Li Keqiang</strong>: About China&rsquo;s population policy, as you said, from last year married couples can have a second child if one of the parents is a single child. Currently we are conducting a comprehensive review of how this policy has been implemented. Based on the outcome of this review and taking into account China&rsquo;s economic and social development and changes in our demographic structure, we will weight both the pros and cons, and make improvements and adjustments to our policy in accordance with legal procedures.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Asahi Shimbun</strong>: This year marks the 70th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. I would like to ask your outlook on history, Mr. Premier. We have also seen that more Chinese tourists have traveled to Japan and bought a lot of things there, but the number of Japanese tourists visiting China as well as Japanese investment in China have both declined. How do you see such a situation? How do you view the possible impact of China&rsquo;s planned commemoration activities, including the military parade, on the sentiments of the Japanese people?</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Li Keqiang</strong>: This year marks the 70th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese People&rsquo;s War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War. Not only China but also many countries in the world have planned to hold diverse forms of commemoration activities. The purpose of these activities is to firmly bear in mind the hard lessons gained from the past and ensure that that kind of history will never repeat itself. The purpose is to uphold the outcomes of the Second World War and the post-war international order and international laws so as to uphold enduring peace of mankind. </p>\n",
      "<p>It is true that the current China-Japan relationship is in difficulty. The crux of the issue is how that war and that part of history are viewed. One needs to hold a right outlook on history, meaning one needs to take history as a mirror and look to the future. For leaders of a country, while inheriting the historical achievements made by their predecessors, they also need to shoulder the historical responsibilities for crimes committed by past generations. The war of aggression imposed on the Chinese people by the Japanese militarists brought untold sufferings, and the average people in Japan were also victims of that war. At such a critical moment this year, China-Japan relationship faces both a test and an opportunity. If leaders of Japan can face history squarely and maintain consistency in how they view that part of history, there will be a new opportunity for improvement and growth of China-Japan relations. It will also create favorable conditions for the growth of business relationship between the two countries. </p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Xinhua News Agency</strong>: Since the beginning of last year, the banks&rsquo; NPL ratio has been increasing and cases of financial risks of shadow banking have occurred from time to time. Soon many local governments will see their debt come due. As the downward pressure on China&rsquo;s economy grows, how do you see the growing financial risks?</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Li Keqiang</strong>: I see financial risks are the focus of your questions. It&rsquo;s true that there have been individual cases of financial risks in China, but we are fully capable of forestalling systemic and regional financial risks. China&rsquo;s economy continues to operate within the proper range and there is a fairly high savings rate in China. Moreover, 70% of local government debts are in the form of investment which boasts quite good prospect for yielding returns. We are also regulating the local government financing vehicles to ensure that we will keep front doors open and block back doors. Chinese banks have a fairly high capital adequacy ratio and ample provisions. It&rsquo;s true that there are non-performing loans and the NPL ratio has risen somewhat. Still, the level is quite low internationally. </p>\n",
      "<p>Let me make clear here: Individual cases of financial risks will be allowed. We encourage the practice of balancing one&rsquo;s book in a market-based way to guard against moral hazard and raise people&rsquo;s awareness of financial risks. This year, we will set up the deposit insurance system and continue to develop multi-tiered capital markets to lower corporate leverage ratio. All these efforts will help ensure that financial services can better serve the real economy.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>TVBS</strong>: There have been certain developments in Taiwan last year which have affected the business cooperation between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits. As the mainland adjusts its economic structure and as mainland&rsquo;s economy slows down, business people from Taiwan operating on the mainland have also run into difficulties. My question is, what steps will the mainland take to boost the cross-Straits business cooperation and ensure that businesses and people from Taiwan can continue to have priority access to the mainland&rsquo;s development opportunities?</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Li Keqiang</strong>: People on both sides of the Taiwan Straits belong to one big family. As long as we continue to adhere to the one-China principle and the 1992 Consensus, oppose Taiwan independence and uphold peaceful development of cross-Straits relations, we will be able to lay a more solid foundation for cross-Straits business cooperation and expand the room for such business ties. To boost the economic cooperation between the two sides, we need to get both wheels in motion. One wheel is to enhance institution building. For example, the follow-up consultations on ECFA should be advanced. The other wheel is to boost mutual opening-up. As far as the mainland is concerned, closer attention will be paid to the investment made by Taiwan business people on the mainland. </p>\n",
      "<p>Here I would like to ask you to convey a message to all these people, which I believe will prove to be quite reassuring to them, that is the mainland will continue to protect the lawful rights and interests of Taiwan business people on the mainland and continue to pursue preferential policies towards them as appropriate. In terms of opening-up, we will give priority to Taiwan in terms of both depth and intensity of opening-up steps. We welcome people from Taiwan, including young people, to the mainland to do business. We also want to further enhance personnel interflow between the two sides so as to bring the hearts and minds of people across the Straits closer to each other.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>KBS</strong>: In the last few months, China&rsquo;s CPI rise hovered at just about 1.5%, and in January this year, the figure was a mere 0.8%. So are we to conclude that China has entered deflation? And some people argue that China is exporting deflation and this has also affected the ROK. What is your response?</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Li Keqiang</strong>: About deflation, there are multiple criteria in evaluating deflation. A major criterion is consecutive negative growth of overall consumer prices in a country. And when it comes to CPI in China, last January we had a positive growth and the figure for February further rebounded. So I don&rsquo;t think there is deflation in China.</p>\n",
      "<p>Consumer prices in China have been quite low recently, but China is not exporting deflation. The truth is we have been on the receiving end of deflation. Let me give you one example. Last year, China bought some 310 million metric tons of crude oil and 930 million tons of iron ores on international markets. The physical volume has been on the rise, but the value contained has declined because of tumble in international commodity prices. And we are also prepared to cope with such a situation. What we hope to see is that there will be a quicker global economic recovery and the global economy will regain its momentum of robust growth. </p>\n",
      "<p><strong>China Daily</strong>: Some people conclude that China has become the number one economy in the world and now poses a challenge to the leadership status of the United States. But they also argue that China is still free riding in international affairs. What is your response to such a view and what are your views on advancing China-US ties?</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Li Keqiang</strong>: The first part of your question is about whether China has become the largest economy in the world. I have heard such a view during overseas visits. But I always feel there are some elements of misleading exaggeration in it. According to those authoritative standards, China is still the second largest economy in the world and more importantly, our per capita GDP is still behind about 80 countries. Some time before this year&rsquo;s Spring Festival I paid visits to places in China&rsquo;s western region. I visited two rural homes. There are mother and a son in one family who live in a very shabby place where wind can easily be felt in the house. And because the family is so poor, the 40-year-old son has no money to get married. The other home has produced a college student. There is a boy and a girl in that family. To support her brother to go to college, the girl has to work in cities and even couldn&rsquo;t come home for family reunion during Spring Festivals. It pains me deeply to see our people living in such distress. I&rsquo;m sure there are many more such families in China. By the standard of the World Bank, we still have 200 million people living in poverty. So I can say that China is still a developing country in every sense of the term.</p>\n",
      "<p>China must manage its own affairs well and maintain development at a reasonable speed. That in itself is China&rsquo;s major contribution to the world. Actually, China is assuming greater due international obligations and responsibilities. Talking about free-riding, for such a big country as ours, how could it get a free ride on anybody&rsquo;s train? What China is doing is to work with other countries to pursue common progress.</p>\n",
      "<p>Development will remain the top priority for China and we need a peaceful international environment for us to focus on domestic development. When it comes to the China-US relationship, this is a relationship between the largest developing country and largest developed country in the world. We have proposed that China and the United States work together to build a new model of major country relations featuring no-conflict, no-confrontation, mutual respect, and win-win cooperation. This year, President Xi Jinping will pay a state visit to the United States at the invitation of his US counterpart. It will give a strong boost to China-US ties.</p>\n",
      "<p>Admittedly, there are differences between China and the United States, but what&rsquo;s more important is that the two countries share extensive common interests. When differences are properly handled, the two sides can channel more energy into expanding the convergence of their interests. One highlight in the China-US relationship is that the two sides are advancing negotiations of a bilateral investment treaty (BIT), and the BIT is built around the pre-establishment national treatment and a negative list. This is to break the ceiling on China-US business cooperation and will open up new dimensions for the growth of China-US ties. Naturally the negotiation will take time, but it has already sent a very clear message to both countries and the wider international community that China-US business ties will get even closer and put the overall China-US relationship on a more solid footing.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Hong Kong Economic Times</strong>: My question is about the constitutional reform in Hong Kong, which is of keen interest to the people of Hong Kong. We are getting closer to the date of voting on the constitutional reform plan, but recently there have been some quite tough statements by the central leadership on this topic. This has made many people not optimistic about the prospect for the constitutional reform bill to be adopted. Also for the first time in the government work report, there is such wording that one needs to strictly comply with the Constitution and the Basic Law. Does this mean that the central government is tightening its policy towards Hong Kong and will that affect the relationship between the central government and the Hong Kong SAR and will that add more uncertainties to the cultural and business interactions between the two sides?</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Li Keqiang</strong>: It is China&rsquo;s basic state policy to adhere to the principles of &ldquo;one country, two systems&rdquo;, &ldquo;the people of Hong Kong governing Hong Kong&rdquo;, &ldquo;the people of Macao governing Macao&rdquo; and both regions enjoying a high degree of autonomy. Some people are worried if the central government is tightening its policy towards Hong Kong. Such a worry is not necessary. It&rsquo;s true that this year&rsquo;s government work report said that one needs to strictly comply with the Constitution and the Basic Law. This actually shows our commitment to ensuring the consistent and full implementation of the &ldquo;one country, two systems&rdquo; principle. This principle has been written into the Constitution and the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR. They together form the constitutional basis of the Hong Kong SAR. The Basic Law has also provided for what system should be practiced in Hong Kong. The &ldquo;one country, two systems&rdquo; principle reflects the will of the country and the people, and cannot be changed at will. Some may feel that I am picking words in answering your question. This is because you asked a question that relates to the law, so I need to answer it with utmost seriousness. </p>\n",
      "<p>The central government will continue to firmly support the government of the Hong Kong SAR and its chief executive in governing the region in accordance with law. And the central government will give stronger support to Hong Kong for it to play its unique role in China&rsquo;s reform, opening-up and modernization drive. We hope that both the mainland and Hong Kong will benefit more from their exchanges and cooperation and people of both sides feel satisfied and see their wellbeing enhanced.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Austrian Radio and Television</strong>: I have a question on foreign policy that is very burning for the Europeans: the continued presence of Russian troops on the territory of Ukraine. What is the position of China? Does China think that this corresponds to international law? A couple of days ago, Russian President Putin has mentioned on Russian television how he planned the invasion of Crimea. Is Crimea, for China, part of Russia now or is it still part of Ukraine?</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Li Keqiang</strong>: China follows an independent foreign policy of peace. On the issue of Ukraine, China has adopted an objective and just position. We respect Ukraine&rsquo;s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. In my meeting with the President of Ukraine last year when I visited some European countries, I said the same words to him. He then asked me if he could make them public. I said no problem, use my words and publish them in the newspaper. The issue of Ukraine has added to the complexity of the geopolitical situation and had its impact on global economic recovery. We hope that there will be a negotiated settlement of this issue through dialogue. As for Crimea, there are complex causes behind this issue. We also hope to see a political settlement of through dialogue. We hope that there will be harmonious coexistence between neighbors. And we hope to see common development and win-win outcomes between Europe and other countries in the world. I believe that is in the interest of all relevant parties and China as well.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>People&rsquo;s Daily</strong>: Just now you mentioned that you bought books on the Internet. My question is related to books.

But for two years in running, to encourage our people to read has been written into the government work report. I would like to know why do you care so deeply about this, and can you share with us your personal experience about reading?</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Li Keqiang</strong>: Last year, in drafting the government work report, I solicited views from representatives of various circles. And I found that not only people from the cultural and publishing sectors, but also those from the economic and business circles suggested that the government needs to further encourage a love of reading among all the people and should write this into its work report. They also said that they feel deeply concerned that the average per capita amount of reading in China is only about one tenth of that of some other countries in the world. What they said made me think deeply. I believe it shows our people not only want to pursue increase of material wealth, but also long for better nourishments of the mind.</p>\n",
      "<p>Books and reading have been essential in carrying forward human civilizations. Reading is what I enjoy the most in my spare time. It makes me feel enriched. And reading has been the most rewarding experience in my life. I hope that all our people can foster a love of reading, and as our people&rsquo;s amount of reading grows, I believe it is also an important symbol of social and cultural progress in China. I hope that more people can make reading a way of living, and find it very useful in work too. Reading can further unlock the potential of innovation and enhance civic morality. That is why I have, for two years running, written this into the government work report, and this will also be the case for next year&rsquo;s government work report.</p>\n",
      "<p>After the moderater announced the end of the press conference, a journalist asked about how the Premier views the recent developments in the border areas between China and Myanmar. Premier Li Keqiang said: What happened there was deeply distressing. There was loss of life and property of Chinese residents in the China-Myanmar border areas. And I want to first express my deep condolences for the lost lives and sympathies to the bereaved families. The Chinese Foreign Ministry and the Chinese military have both made stern representations with Myanmar. And we have the responsibility and the capacity to firmly safeguard security and stability in the China-Myanmar border areas and firmly protect the life and property of our people.</p>\n",
      "<p>The press conference, lasting some two hours, was held in the golden hall on the third floor of the Great Hall of the People. Nearly 900 Chinese and foreign journalists attended the press conference.</p>\n"
